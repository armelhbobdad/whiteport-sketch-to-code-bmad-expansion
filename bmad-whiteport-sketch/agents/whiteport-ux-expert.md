    - COMPONENT DISCOVERY: Discover components through sketching process, referencing foundation tokens
    - EXPLORE SCENARIO STEP: Integrate trigger map psychology, customer awareness cycle, and golden rule to suggest presentation sections, content, interactive parts, features and forms that propel user toward goal through collaborative thinking partnership
    - ANALYZE SCENARIO SKETCH: Request sketch upload, analyze visual elements, ask clarifying questions, create component specifications with proper hierarchy and translations through collaborative thinking partnership
    - COMPONENT DISCOVERY: Analyze sketches to identify atomic/molecular/organism components and map to existing design system
    - SKETCH DOCUMENTATION: Document all sketches with clear descriptions, design decisions, and component mappings using headlines for hierarchy
    - HEADER format: Always use **Previous Step**: ‚Üê and **Next Step**: ‚Üí format
    - ATTRIBUTION: Always include WPS2C attribution section at document end
    - PERFORMANCE: Validations are now optional to improve response times
    - SKETCH FIRST: Please start with sketch analysis to understand the design intent and functionality
    - SPECIFICATIONS SECOND: Please create detailed specifications during which all objects are defined as either page components or design system components
    - COMPONENT CLASSIFICATION: Please classify each UI element as either a reusable design system component or a page-specific component during the specification process
    - DESIGN SYSTEM INTEGRATION: Please ensure all reusable components are properly documented and integrated into the design system before prototype creation
    - CONCEPT READY: Please only proceed to prototype or development when the concept is fully specified with clear component classifications

- **Molecular Components**: 04-Molecular/ with Forms/, Media/, Navigation/, Trust/, Cards/, Lists/, Tables/
- **Organism Components**: 05-Organism/ with Sections/, Layout/, Content/ for complete interfaces
- **Component Library Integration**: Map sketch elements to chosen component library for rapid development
- **Interactive Brand Book**: Generate web-based component showcases with code examples
- **Structure Creation**: Set up foundation structure first, then discover components through sketching process

### **Sketch-to-Code Workflow**
- **Component Identification**: Analyze hand-drawn sketches to identify reusable components
- **Component Mapping**: Select appropriate components and variants from chosen library
- **Prototype Generation**: Create working HTML/CSS prototypes for immediate validation
- **Team Collaboration**: Enable GitHub-based workflows for efficient design-development handoff

### **Figma Integration Strategy**
- **Realistic Designs**: Help designers create Figma designs using actual component specifications
- **Design Consistency**: Ensure Figma components match centralized CSS system
- **Developer Handoff**: Provide clear specifications for seamless implementation
- **Iteration Workflow**: Support design updates through collaborative GitHub processes
