# Mandatory Agent Documentation Review Protocol

## PURPOSE

This protocol establishes NON-NEGOTIABLE requirements for ALL Whiteport Agents to perform comprehensive documentation review before ANY document creation, modification, or editing work.

## CRITICAL MANDATE

**ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY**: Any Whiteport Agent that creates, modifies, or edits documents without following this protocol is operating outside WPS2C standards and must immediately correct their approach.

## MANDATORY REVIEW CHECKLIST

ALL agents MUST complete this checklist before ANY document work:

### 1. WPS2C Standards Compliance Check
- [ ] Read complete WPS2C documentation standards
- [ ] Verify Zero Tolerance Parentheses Policy understanding
- [ ] Confirm Title-Case-With-Dashes naming convention requirements
- [ ] Review professional language and enterprise documentation standards

### 2. Component Linking Standards Verification
- [ ] Confirm clickable header format: `### [Component Name](path)`
- [ ] Confirm arrow navigation format: `â†’ [Component Name](path)`
- [ ] Verify Referenced Components section requirements
- [ ] Test all relative paths for accuracy

### 3. Project Context Integration
- [ ] Read current project brief and trigger map
- [ ] Review existing scenario documentation
- [ ] Understand target user personas and business objectives
- [ ] Confirm bilingual content requirements (SE/EN format)

### 4. File Structure Standards
- [ ] Verify fidelity-based folder organization requirements
- [ ] Confirm URL-safe naming conventions
- [ ] Check folder structure specifications (Sketches/, Wireframes/, etc.)
- [ ] Validate professional enterprise organization standards

## ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL

### Agent Activation Requirements
ALL agent activation instructions MUST include explicit references to:
1. **Mandatory Documentation Review**: Link to this protocol
2. **Component Linking Standards**: Explicit format requirements
3. **WPS2C Compliance Check**: Complete standards review mandate
4. **Project Context Review**: Required foundational document reading

### Quality Gates
- **Document Creation**: No document may be created without completing review checklist
- **Document Modification**: No existing document may be modified without standards verification
- **Component References**: All component links must follow established patterns
- **Cross-References**: All file links must be tested and verified

## VIOLATION CORRECTION PROTOCOL

When WPS2C standards violations are detected:

1. **Immediate Halt**: Stop all document work immediately
2. **Standards Review**: Complete full documentation review checklist
3. **Violation Assessment**: Identify specific standards violated
4. **Surgical Correction**: Apply minimal targeted fixes only
5. **Verification**: Test all changes for compliance and link integrity

## AGENT CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS

All Whiteport Agent configuration files MUST include:

```yaml
activation-instructions:
  - CRITICAL: MANDATORY WPS2C DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS CHECK
  - Before ANY document work, complete mandatory-agent-documentation-review-protocol.md
  - Verify Component Linking Standards (clickable headers, arrow navigation)
  - Confirm bilingual content requirements and project context
  - NO EXCEPTIONS: Zero tolerance for standards violations
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

This protocol is successful when:
- [ ] All agents consistently follow WPS2C standards
- [ ] Component linking is uniform across all documentation
- [ ] No broken links or inconsistent references exist
- [ ] Professional enterprise documentation standards are maintained
- [ ] Project stakeholders can navigate documentation intuitively

## CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

This protocol will be updated based on:
- Real-world agent performance analysis
- User feedback on documentation quality
- Identified standards violations and their solutions
- Evolution of WPS2C methodology best practices

**REMEMBER**: Professional documentation excellence requires consistent standards application. Every agent interaction either reinforces or undermines project documentation quality.
