# PRD and Backlog Organization Standards

## Overview

This document captures the organizational standards and naming conventions developed for the Whiteport Sketch-to-Code method, specifically for structuring Product Requirements Documents (PRD) and Development Backlogs in a way that maximizes clarity, efficiency, and business value alignment.

## Core Principles

### Separation of Strategic vs. Tactical Documentation
- **D-PRD/**: Strategic and technical specifications (WHAT to build)
- **E-Backlog/**: Tactical development work items (HOW and WHEN to build)

### Value-Focused Naming
- All initiatives, epics, and stories must reflect business value and user outcomes
- Avoid technical implementation details in names
- Focus on what users achieve, not what systems do

### Scenario-Based Initiative Mapping
- Initiatives should map to user scenarios from C-Scenarios/
- Initiative names reflect what we BUILD to enable user scenarios
- Platform infrastructure initiatives enable multiple scenarios

## Folder Structure Standards

### Complete Project Structure
```
Project-Root/
├── A-Product-Brief/              # Strategic foundation
├── B-Trigger-Map/               # User research & personas
├── C-Scenarios/                 # User journey scenarios
├── D-PRD/                       # Technical specifications
├── E-Backlog/                   # Development work items
└── F-Maintenance/               # Bugs, feedback, tech debt (future)
```

### D-PRD Structure - Product Requirements Document
```
D-PRD/
├── 00-PRD-Overview.md                    # Development context & Product Brief references
├── 01-Functional-Requirements.md         # Detailed feature specifications
├── 02-API-Specifications.md              # Technical contracts & endpoints
├── 03-Data-Models.md                     # Database schemas & relationships
├── 04-Integration-Specifications.md      # External system protocols
├── 05-Performance-Requirements.md        # Benchmarks & scalability specs
├── 06-Security-Specifications.md         # Compliance & encryption details
└── 07-Acceptance-Criteria.md             # Testable success definitions
```

### E-Backlog Structure - Development Work Items
```
E-Backlog/
├── 00-Implementation-Roadmap.md          # Development sequence & release planning
├── I01-Platform-Foundation/
│   ├── I01-Platform-Foundation.md        # Initiative overview
│   ├── E01-Trusted-User-Access/
│   │   ├── E01-Trusted-User-Access.md    # Epic overview (matches folder name)
│   │   ├── E01-S01-User-Registration.md
│   │   ├── E01-S02-Company-Login.md
│   │   └── E01-S03-Role-Permissions.md
│   ├── E02-Google-Integration/
│   └── E03-Office365-Integration/
├── I02-Public-Website/                   # Future initiative
└── I03-Mobile-Experience/                # Future initiative
```

## Naming Conventions

### Prefix System
- **I##**: Initiatives - I01, I02, I03 and so on
- **E##**: Epics - E01, E02, E03 and so on  
- **S##**: Stories - S01, S02, S03 and so on

### File Naming Rules
- **Overview Files**: Must match folder names exactly
  - Folder: `E01-Trusted-User-Access/`
  - File: `E01-Trusted-User-Access.md`
- **Story Files**: Use E##-S##-Descriptive-Name format
  - `E01-S01-User-Registration.md`
  - `E01-S02-Company-Login.md`
- **All Names**: Use Title-Case-With-Dashes format

### Value-Focused Naming Guidelines

#### Initiative Names
- Reflect what we BUILD to enable user scenarios
- NOT what users do: ❌ "Browse-Public-Website"
- BUT what we build: ✅ "Public-Website"
- Remove redundant verbs (Create, Build, Develop) for optimization

#### Epic Names
- Focus on business value and user benefits
- NOT technical components: ❌ "Authentication-System"
- BUT user value: ✅ "Trusted-User-Access"
- Reflect outcomes users care about

#### Story Names
- Format: E##-S##-Descriptive-Story-Name
- Describe user value outcomes in the descriptive name
- Should be completable in one sprint
- Each page/feature/component = separate story
- Focus on "As a [user], I can [goal] so that [benefit]" outcomes
- Epic number inheritance ensures clear hierarchy and unique identification

## Implementation Roadmap Standards

### Content Requirements
The `00-Implementation-Roadmap.md` must include:

#### Release Planning
- **Release 1.0**: Platform Foundation (target dates)
- **Release 1.1**: Enhanced Features (target dates)
- **Release 2.0**: Full User Experience (target dates)

#### Development Sequence
- Initiative priorities and dependencies
- Epic development order within initiatives
- Story breakdown and sprint planning
- Risk mitigation strategies

#### Resource Allocation
- Team assignments and responsibilities
- Parallel development stream coordination
- Timeline and milestone targets

## Quality Standards

### Documentation Completeness
- Every initiative must have overview document
- Every epic must have overview document matching folder name
- Every story must include acceptance criteria
- All technical specifications must reference Product Brief

### Business Value Alignment
- All work items must trace back to user scenarios
- Technical debt and infrastructure must show business value
- No purely technical initiatives without user benefit justification

### Scalability Requirements
- Naming system supports unlimited growth from I01 to I99, E01 to E99, S01 to S99
- Folder structure accommodates new initiatives without reorganization
- Cross-references between D-PRD and E-Backlog must be maintained

## Integration with Whiteport Method

### Workflow Sequence
1. **A-Product-Brief**: Strategic foundation established
2. **B-Trigger-Map**: User research and personas completed
3. **C-Scenarios**: User journey scenarios defined
4. **D-PRD + E-Backlog**: Platform infrastructure planning (current phase)
5. **UI Specifications**: Added to E-Backlog after sketching phase

### Parallel Development Enablement
- Platform infrastructure initiatives can proceed immediately
- UI-focused initiatives wait for conceptual specification completion
- API specifications in D-PRD enable frontend development
- Implementation roadmap coordinates all development streams

## Success Criteria

### Organizational Effectiveness
- Development teams can navigate structure intuitively
- Stakeholders can find relevant information quickly
- Business value is clear at every level of hierarchy
- Technical specifications support immediate development

### Agile Compatibility
- Structure supports standard agile practices
- Epic and story breakdown enables sprint planning
- Release planning integrates with development roadmap
- Maintenance work can be added without disrupting feature development

### Long-term Sustainability
- Documentation structure scales with project growth
- Naming conventions remain consistent across team changes
- Cross-references between sections remain accurate
- Business value focus prevents technical debt accumulation
