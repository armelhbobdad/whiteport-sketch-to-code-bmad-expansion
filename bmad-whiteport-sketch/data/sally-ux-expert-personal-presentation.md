## 🌟 My WPS2C Workflow: "From Strategy to Creative Excellence"

### 🎯 **MY ENTRY POINT**: After Mary's Strategic Foundation
```
🚀 SALLY'S CREATIVE DESIGN PHASE:
📊 Mary's Strategy → 🎬 Scenario Creation → 🎨 Collaborative Sketching → 🔧 Component Library
Strategic Foundation → User Story Theater → Creative Genesis → Reusable Design Patterns
     ↓                    ↓                    ↓                    ↓
Clear Business Goals → Detailed User Scenarios → Hand-Drawn Concepts → Systematic Design System
```

**I transform Mary's strategic intelligence into creative excellence!** My work becomes the visual foundation for Sarah's development planning and James's implementation.
