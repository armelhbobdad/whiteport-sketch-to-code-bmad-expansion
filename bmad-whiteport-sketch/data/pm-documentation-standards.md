# PM Documentation Standards

## Overview

This document defines the standards and expectations for Product Manager documentation within the Whiteport Sketch-to-Code method, ensuring consistency and clarity for development team handoff and systematic coordination excellence.

## Critical Compliance Requirements

### Professional Documentation Standards
- Use clear, professional language throughout all documentation
- Prefer direct explanations over parenthetical additions
- Use professional alternatives: "including", "designed for", "meaning", "such as", "for example"
- Example: "Backend services including authentication and data management" is clearer than "Backend services (authentication and data management)"
- Exception: Technical code examples where parentheses are syntactically required

### Professional Naming Conventions (Enhanced Client Readability)
- **Title-Case-With-Dashes**: All folders and files use this format for improved readability
- **D-PRD/**: Product Requirements Documentation folder structure
- **E-Backlog/**: Epic and story execution planning folder structure
- **URL-Safe Compatibility**: Eliminate spaces, special characters, and case-sensitive paths
- **Client Accessibility**: Long file names are easier to read for non-technical clients and stakeholders
- **Stakeholder Presentation**: All documentation must be immediately discoverable by business users

## Two-Phase PRD Documentation Standards

### Phase 1: Establish PRD + Platform Requirements
Required documentation structure:
```
D-PRD/
├── 01-Platform-Architecture.md      ← Infrastructure design specifications
├── 02-Backend-Requirements.md       ← API and data system requirements
├── 03-Integration-Specifications.md ← Service coordination plans
└── 04-Quality-Standards.md          ← Testing and performance criteria
```

### Phase 2: Add Functional Requirements to PRD
Enhanced documentation structure:
```
D-PRD/
├── 05-UI-Component-Requirements.md  ← Frontend component specifications
├── 06-User-Experience-Flows.md      ← Interaction specifications
├── 07-Feature-Acceptance-Criteria.md ← UI/UX success definitions
└── 08-Integration-Testing-Plans.md  ← Full system coordination
```

## Epic and Story Documentation Standards

### Epic Structure Requirements
```
E-Backlog/epics/
├── Phase-1-Platform-Epics/
│   ├── 01-Platform-Foundation-Epic.md
│   ├── 02-Backend-Services-Epic.md
│   └── 03-System-Integration-Epic.md
└── Phase-2-Functional-Epics/
    ├── 04-UI-Implementation-Epic.md
    ├── 05-User-Experience-Epic.md
    └── 06-Feature-Integration-Epic.md
```

### Story Organization Requirements
```
E-Backlog/stories/
├── platform-stories/    ← Immediate development from Phase 1 PRD
├── backend-stories/      ← API development from Phase 1 PRD
├── ui-stories/          ← Frontend development from Phase 2 PRD
└── integration-stories/ ← System coordination from Phase 2 PRD
```
