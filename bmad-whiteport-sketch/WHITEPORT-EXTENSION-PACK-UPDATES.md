# Whiteport Extension Pack Updates

**Date**: Monday, September 15, 2025  
**Version**: 2.1  
**Focus**: C-Scenarios and D-Design-System Integration

## Major Updates

### **UX Expert Agent Enhancement**

#### **New Responsibilities**
- **C-Scenarios Structure**: Create and manage scenario folder structure
- **D-Design-System Structure**: Create and manage design system folder structure
- **Integrated Workflow**: Connect sketches to components seamlessly
- **Structure Creation**: Both folder systems created during conceptual design phase

#### **Updated Commands**
- `create-design-system-structure`: Now creates both C-Scenarios and D-Design-System structures
- Enhanced focus on integrated workflow between sketches and components

#### **Updated Behavioral Conditioning**
- **DURING work**: Use absolute paths (`/docs/C-Scenarios/` and `/docs/D-Design-System/`) exclusively
- **STRUCTURE CREATION**: Create both C-Scenarios and D-Design-System folder structures during conceptual design phase
- **INTEGRATION**: Connect sketches to components seamlessly

### **New Task: create-design-system-structure.md**

#### **Scope Expansion**
- **C-Scenarios Structure**: Complete scenario folder organization
- **D-Design-System Structure**: Focused component system based on actual needs
- **Integration**: Link sketches to components
- **Workflow**: Connect C-Scenarios to D-Design-System

#### **Process Steps**
1. **Analyze Project Needs**: Review sketches and referenced components
2. **Create C-Scenarios Structure**: Organize scenario folders and content
3. **Create D-Design-System Structure**: Build component system based on actual needs
4. **Create Design Tokens**: Foundation for consistency
5. **Create Component Structure**: Only referenced components
6. **Create Component Specifications**: Three-file structure
7. **Link Sketches to Components**: Connect C-Scenarios to D-Design-System

### **New Template: design-system-structure-tmpl.yaml**

#### **C-Scenarios Structure**
```yaml
c_scenarios:
  required: true
  structure:
    - "C-Scenarios/"
    - "C-Scenarios/01-Customer-Onboarding/"
    - "C-Scenarios/02-Family-Setup/"
    - "C-Scenarios/03-Walk-Scheduling/"
    - "C-Scenarios/04-Parental-Oversight/"
```

#### **D-Design-System Structure**
```yaml
d_design_system:
  required: true
  structure:
    - "D-Design-System/"
    - "D-Design-System/02-Foundation/"
    - "D-Design-System/03-Atomic-Components/"
    - "D-Design-System/04-Molecular-Components/"
    - "D-Design-System/05-Organism-Components/"
```

## Key Benefits

### **Integrated Workflow**
- **Seamless Connection**: Sketches and components work together
- **No Duplication**: Single source of truth for design decisions
- **Consistent Structure**: Both systems follow WPS2C methodology
- **Swedish Focus**: Both systems optimized for Swedish families

### **Focused Approach**
- **No Speculation**: Only create what's actually needed
- **Real Value**: Every component serves a specific purpose
- **Lean Structure**: Avoid unnecessary complexity
- **Practical Implementation**: Immediate use for current project

### **WPS2C Integration**
- **Three-File Structure**: Specification, sketch, and code for each component
- **Design Tokens**: Consistent foundation across both systems
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance built-in
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Swedish family needs integrated

## Implementation Impact

### **For UX Experts**
- **Clear Responsibility**: Manage both sketches and components
- **Integrated Workflow**: Connect design to implementation
- **Focused Approach**: Only create what's needed
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintain WPS2C standards

### **For Projects**
- **Consistent Structure**: Both C and D folders follow same methodology
- **No Bloat**: Only components referenced in sketches
- **Swedish Optimization**: Both systems designed for Swedish families
- **Immediate Value**: Every component serves a purpose

### **For Development Teams**
- **Clear Documentation**: Both sketches and components documented
- **Component Library**: Production-ready React components
- **Design Tokens**: Consistent styling foundation
- **Accessibility**: Built-in compliance standards

## Usage Guidelines

### **When to Use**
- **Conceptual Design Phase**: Create both structures during initial design
- **Sketching Process**: Link sketches to component specifications
- **Component Development**: Build components based on actual sketches
- **Project Growth**: Add components only when referenced in new sketches

### **Best Practices**
- **Start with C-Scenarios**: Create scenario structure first
- **Build D-Design-System**: Create components based on scenario needs
- **Link Everything**: Connect sketches to components
- **Maintain Focus**: Only create what's actually needed
