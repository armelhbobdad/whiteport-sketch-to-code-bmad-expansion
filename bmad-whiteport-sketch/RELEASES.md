* **New Templates**: The pack includes a new **`synopsis-tmpl.yaml`** for documenting your sketches and a new **`trigger-map-tmpl.yaml`** for creating a mind map of your strategic goals.
* **Orchestrated Workflow**: The **`whiteport-design-workflow.yaml`** file now guides you step-by-step through the entire process, from ideation and sketching to the handoff for development.
