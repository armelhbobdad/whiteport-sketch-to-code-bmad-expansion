# formalize-content-strategy

## Purpose

To create a systematic, repeatable process for generating strategically aligned content using the integrated Trigger Map + Awareness Level + Golden Circle framework. This formalized methodology ensures every content decision is research-backed and purposefully structured.

## The 5-Point Strategic Content Formula

Content should be presented after considering:

1. **What we want them to do** (Business goals drive everything)
2. **Married to what the user wants** (Persona usage goals alignment) 
3. **In a way that takes care of their driving forces** (Address fears, support desires)
4. **In a level of complexity matching their knowledge level** (Awareness-appropriate content)
5. **Starting with WHY!** (Golden Circle structure with purpose-first language)

### **Expanded Formula Framework**

**FOUNDATION**: Business Goals (PRIMARY) - Why this system should exist  
**INPUT**: Business Goals + User Wants + Driving Forces + Knowledge Level + Purpose-First Structure  
**PROCESS**: 5-Point Strategic Alignment + Golden Circle Implementation  
**OUTPUT**: Business-Driving AI Content Prompts + Purpose-Driven Messaging That Achieves Objectives

## Step-by-Step Formalized Process

### Phase 1: 5-Point Strategic Alignment

#### **Step 1.1: Define What We Want Them To Do (FOUNDATION)**
START HERE: Identify the specific business goal this page/section must achieve:
- **Primary Business Goal**: Main objective (engagement, conversion, education, retention, etc.)
- **Success Metric**: How success will be measured (quantifiable outcomes)
- **Strategic Priority**: Importance relative to other business goals
- **Business Value**: Expected impact on overall business objectives
- **Resource Justification**: Why this interactive system is worth building
- **ROI Expectations**: How this contributes to business success

**Critical Questions**:
- What business outcome does this page/section MUST deliver?
- How will we measure if this business goal is achieved?
- What happens to the business if this goal is NOT achieved?
- Why is an interactive system the right solution for this business goal?

#### **Step 1.2: Identify What The User Wants (Marriage Point)**
Match personas to business objectives by finding mutual benefit:
- **Primary Persona**: Which persona's actions most directly serve the business goal?
- **Secondary Personas**: Which other personas contribute to this business objective?
- **Persona Business Value**: How each persona's success contributes to business success
- **Conversion Path**: How persona actions translate to business outcomes

**Primary Usage Goals**: What they want to achieve (positive goals)
- **Avoidance Goals**: What they fear or want to prevent (negative goals)
- **Personal Context**: Background, role, situation, constraints
- **Relationship to Core Activity**: How they relate to the product/service domain
- **Business Goal Overlap**: Where their wants intersect with business needs

#### **Step 1.3: Address Their Driving Forces**
Extract psychological motivators that enable business goal achievement:

From the trigger map, identify for the TARGET BUSINESS-ALIGNED PERSONA:
- **Positive Driving Forces**: What they want to achieve that aligns with business goals
- **Negative Driving Forces**: What they fear/avoid that business success can address
- **Emotional Triggers**: Deep motivators that drive action
- **Trust Builders**: What reduces anxiety and builds confidence

#### **Step 1.4: Match Their Knowledge Level**
Determine user's awareness state ALIGNED with business goal achievement:
- **Current Awareness Level**: Where users start (Unaware â†’ Most Aware)
- **Business-Aligned Target Level**: Where they need to be to take the business-desired action
- **Business-Critical Awareness Gap**: What understanding is required for business goal achievement
- **Business-Driven Progression Strategy**: How to advance awareness specifically to enable business outcome

#### **Step 1.5: Start With WHY Structure**
Apply Golden Circle framework to ensure purpose-first messaging:
- **WHY Foundation**: Core purpose that serves both business goals and user wants
- **HOW Bridge**: Unique approach that addresses driving forces while achieving business objectives
- **WHAT Delivery**: Specific outcomes that match knowledge level and drive business results

### Phase 2: 5-Point Content Implementation

#### **Step 2.1: 5-Point Strategic Content Hierarchy**
Structure content using the 5-point formula integrated with Golden Circle progression:

**Point 1 + 5: What We Want + WHY Structure**

- Frame business-desired actions as natural outcomes of shared purpose
- Use WHY-first language in every section and sentence

**Point 2: Married to What User Wants**

- Demonstrate how business success enables user success
- Present business-desired actions as pathways to user goal achievement

**Point 3: Care for Driving Forces**
- Address negative driving forces (fears/avoidance) through reassurance and proof
- Amplify positive driving forces through possibility and aspiration
- Use emotional resonance to build trust and motivation

**Point 4: Match Knowledge Level**
- Present information at appropriate awareness level complexity
- Provide exactly the right amount of detail for current understanding
- Guide progression to next awareness level that enables business goal

**Point 5: WHY-First Implementation**

#### **Step 2.2: WHY-First Language Structure**
Ensure every section and sentence begins with purpose-driven language:

**Section Opening Formula**:
- Start with belief/purpose statement that connects to persona usage goals
- Frame the belief in terms of what the persona deserves/should experience
- Connect to their positive usage goals while acknowledging negative concerns

**Sentence Construction Pattern**:
- **Primary Pattern**: "We believe [purpose] because [persona-specific reason]"
- **Secondary Pattern**: "Since [persona situation], [purpose-driven solution]"
- **Supporting Pattern**: "Understanding [persona concern], we [purpose-driven approach]"

### Phase 3: AI Prompt Generation
