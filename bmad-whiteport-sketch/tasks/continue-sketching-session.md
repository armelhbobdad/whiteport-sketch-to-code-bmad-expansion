# Continue Sketching Session

## Purpose

To resume or continue an existing sketching session with additional exploration, refinement, or new perspectives. This process enables designers to build upon previous sketching work while maintaining systematic component discovery and design system integration.

## WPS2C Method Vision

**Providing a thinking partner to every designer on the planet** - enabling designers everywhere to give more of what is valuable to the world. With deep understanding of users, technology, and what drives people, we provide functionality, beauty, simplicity, and make software endlessly successful by giving people both what they want and what they need.

This continuation process ensures that sketching sessions remain productive and focused while building systematically toward implementable solutions.

## Core Philosophy

- **Iterative Exploration** - Build upon previous sketches with new insights and perspectives
- **Systematic Refinement** - Improve existing sketches based on feedback and discoveries
- **Component Evolution** - Refine component identification and design system mapping
- **User-Centered Progression** - Maintain focus on user needs while exploring new solutions
- **Design System Integration** - Continuously improve component mapping and specifications
