# Analyze Existing Sketch

## Purpose

To analyze uploaded sketches, ask clarifying questions, and create component specifications with proper hierarchy and translations. This process transforms existing sketches into detailed, implementation-ready specifications that integrate with the design system.

## WPS2C Method Vision

**Providing a thinking partner to every designer on the planet** - enabling designers everywhere to give more of what is valuable to the world. With deep understanding of users, technology, and what drives people, we provide functionality, beauty, simplicity, and make software endlessly successful by giving people both what they want and what they need.

This sketch analysis process is a core component of that vision - helping designers transform their creative work into implementable solutions through systematic analysis and specification.

## Core Philosophy

- **Collaborative Analysis** - Work with designer to understand sketch intent and details
- **Systematic Documentation** - Create comprehensive specifications with proper hierarchy
- **Design System Integration** - Link all elements to existing design system components
- **Translation Completeness** - Ensure all copy includes necessary translations
- **Implementation Readiness** - Create specifications that developers can immediately use
- **WPS2C Compliance** - Follow all documentation standards and naming conventions

## Phase 1: Sketch Upload and Initial Analysis

### Purpose
Request sketch upload and perform initial visual analysis to understand the interface structure.

### Process

#### Step 1.1: Sketch Upload Request
**Request:**
- "Please upload your sketch to the Sketches folder in this scenario step"
- "Make the sketch available in the chat so I can analyze it"
- "I'll need to see the image to provide detailed analysis"
- "Please ensure the image is clear and shows all interface elements"

#### Step 1.2: Visual Elements Identification
**Analyze:**
1. **Layout Structure**: Overall page organization and section hierarchy
2. **Visual Components**: Buttons, forms, images, icons, and other interface elements
3. **Content Areas**: Headlines, body text, labels, and messaging
4. **Interactive Elements**: Clickable areas, form fields, and navigation
5. **Visual Hierarchy**: How elements are prioritized and organized

#### Step 1.3: User Flow Analysis
**Trace:**
- **Entry Point**: How user arrives at this interface
- **Primary Actions**: What user needs to accomplish
- **Navigation Path**: How user moves through the interface
- **Exit Points**: Where user goes next in their journey
- **Decision Points**: Where user makes choices or provides input

#### Step 1.4: Initial Questions Preparation
**Prepare:**
- Questions about unclear or ambiguous elements
- Requests for clarification on user interactions
- Inquiries about content and messaging details
- Questions about responsive behavior and states

### Output
- Complete visual analysis of sketch elements
- Understanding of interface structure and user flow
- Prepared questions for collaborative clarification

## Phase 2: Collaborative Clarification

### Purpose
Work with designer to clarify sketch details and understand design intent.

### Process

#### Step 2.1: Element-by-Element Clarification
**Ask:**
- "I can see [specific elements] in your sketch - can you explain this section?"
- "What happens when the user interacts with [specific element]?"
- "How does this connect to the user's goal in this scenario?"
- "Are there any parts that aren't clear from the sketch alone?"

#### Step 2.2: User Experience Clarification
**Clarify:**
- "What is the user thinking when they see this section?"
- "What emotions are you trying to evoke with this design?"
- "How does this element help the user progress toward their goal?"
- "What information does the user need to make decisions here?"

#### Step 2.3: Interaction Details
**Understand:**
- "What happens when the user clicks this button?"
- "How does this form validate user input?"
- "What feedback does the user receive for their actions?"
- "How does this element respond to different user states?"

#### Step 2.4: Content and Messaging
**Clarify:**
- "What is the exact copy for this headline?"
- "What tone and voice should this messaging have?"
- "Are there any specific words or phrases that are important?"
- "How should this content adapt for different user personas?"

#### Step 2.5: Technical Considerations
**Understand:**
- "How should this element behave on mobile devices?"
- "What happens if the user has slow internet connection?"
- "How does this work with screen readers and accessibility?"
- "What are the loading states and error conditions?"

### Output
- Complete understanding of sketch intent and details
- Clarified user experience and interaction patterns
- Detailed content and messaging requirements
- Technical and accessibility considerations

## Phase 3: Component Specification Creation

### Purpose
Create detailed component specifications with proper hierarchy and comprehensive documentation.

### Process

#### Step 3.1: Component Identification
**Identify:**
- **Atomic Components**: Buttons, inputs, icons, typography elements
- **Molecular Components**: Forms, cards, navigation elements, lists
- **Organism Components**: Headers, sections, layouts, complete interfaces
- **Custom Components**: Unique elements that need new specifications

#### Step 3.2: Specification Structure
**Create:**
- **Component Name**: Clear, descriptive name following WPS2C naming conventions
- **Purpose**: What the component does and why it exists
- **Visual Properties**: Size, color, typography, spacing specifications
- **Interactive States**: Default, hover, active, disabled, focus states
- **Content Requirements**: Copy, translations, and messaging needs
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels

#### Step 3.3: Hierarchy Documentation
**Document:**
- **Main Headlines**: Use # for primary page sections
- **Subheadings**: Use ## for major component groups
- **Component Headers**: Use ### for individual components
- **Sub-components**: Use #### for component variations
- **Details**: Use ##### for specific properties and states

#### Step 3.4: Content and Translation Integration
**Integrate:**
- **Primary Copy**: Main headlines and messaging
- **Secondary Copy**: Supporting text and descriptions
- **Button Text**: Call-to-action and interactive element copy
- **Form Labels**: Input labels and validation messages
- **Translations**: Complete Swedish and English versions
- **Tone and Voice**: Consistent messaging approach

### Output
- Complete component specifications with proper hierarchy
- Comprehensive content and translation integration
- Clear documentation structure following WPS2C standards

## Phase 4: Design System Integration

### Purpose
Link all components to existing design system and identify integration opportunities.

### Process

#### Step 4.1: Existing Component Mapping
**Map:**
- **Exact Matches**: Components that directly match existing design system
- **Close Matches**: Components that need minor adjustments
- **Partial Matches**: Components that use some existing elements
- **New Components**: Components that need to be created

#### Step 4.2: Design Token Integration
**Integrate:**
- **Color Tokens**: Map to existing color palette and semantic colors
- **Typography Tokens**: Use existing font families, sizes, and weights
- **Spacing Tokens**: Apply consistent margin, padding, and gap spacing
- **Breakpoint Tokens**: Use responsive design system breakpoints

#### Step 4.3: Component Library Links
**Create:**
- **Atomic Component Links**: Link to existing atomic components
- **Molecular Component Links**: Link to existing molecular components
- **Organism Component Links**: Link to existing organism components
- **New Component Specifications**: Create specifications for new components

#### Step 4.4: Design System Enhancement
**Identify:**
- **New Design Tokens**: Additional tokens needed for customization
- **Component Variants**: New variants for existing components
- **Pattern Extensions**: Ways to extend existing patterns
- **Documentation Updates**: Design system documentation improvements

### Output
- Complete design system integration mapping
- Identified enhancement opportunities
- Clear component library organization
