**Task**: Discuss and plan C-Scenarios structure with user before creating folders  
**Agent**: whiteport-ux-expert  
**Phase**: Conceptual Design & Sketching  
**Priority**: High

## Task Overview

The UX Expert should discuss the C-Scenarios structure with the user before creating any folders. This ensures the structure matches the project's actual needs and gets user approval.

## Prerequisites

- Project has completed A-Product-Brief and B-Trigger-Map phases
- Conceptual design phase has begun
- User is ready to discuss scenario structure

## Dialog Process

### **Step 1: Analyze Project Context**
1. **Review Project Brief**: Understand the project's goals and target users
2. **Review Trigger Map**: Understand user personas and their needs
3. **Identify Key Scenarios**: Determine what scenarios are needed for this project
4. **Prepare Discussion Points**: Ready to discuss scenario categories

### **Step 2: Present Scenario Options**
1. **Show Generic Structure**: Present example C-Scenarios folder structure
2. **Explain Categories**: Explain what each scenario category would contain
3. **Ask for Input**: Ask user what scenarios they need for their project
4. **Listen to Requirements**: Understand user's specific needs

### **Step 3: Discuss Customization**
1. **Scenario Categories**: Discuss what scenario categories make sense
2. **Naming Conventions**: Discuss appropriate naming for their project
3. **Content Structure**: Discuss what content goes in each scenario
4. **Integration**: Discuss how scenarios connect to design system

### **Step 4: Get User Approval**
1. **Present Final Structure**: Show proposed structure based on discussion
2. **Confirm Categories**: Get user approval for scenario categories
3. **Confirm Naming**: Get user approval for naming conventions
4. **Confirm Content**: Get user approval for content structure

### **Step 5: Create Structure (Only After Approval)**
1. **Create C-Scenarios Folder**: Main scenarios directory
2. **Create Scenario Folders**: Only approved scenario categories
3. **Create Content Structure**: Only approved content structure
4. **Document Decisions**: Record what was decided and why

## Dialog Guidelines

### **For UX Expert**
- **Listen First**: Understand user's needs before suggesting structure
- **Ask Questions**: Clarify requirements and preferences
- **Present Options**: Show different structure possibilities
- **Get Approval**: Never create folders without user approval

### **For User**
- **Be Specific**: Explain what scenarios you need for your project
- **Ask Questions**: Clarify any confusion about structure options
- **Provide Feedback**: Give input on proposed structure
- **Make Decisions**: Approve structure before creation

## Example Dialog Flow

### **UX Expert**: "Let's discuss the C-Scenarios structure for your project. Based on your project brief, I can see you need scenarios for [specific project needs]. What scenario categories do you think would work best for your project?"

### **User**: "I need scenarios for [user's specific needs]"

### **UX Expert**: "Great! Based on your needs, I suggest this structure: [present structure]. Does this make sense for your project? Would you like to modify any categories?"

### **User**: "Yes, that looks good, but I'd like to change [specific modifications]"

### **UX Expert**: "Perfect! So the final structure will be [final structure]. Should I create these folders now?"

### **User**: "Yes, please create the structure"

## Success Criteria
