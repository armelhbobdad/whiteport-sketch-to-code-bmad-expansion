# escalate-story-analysis

## Task Description
Perform complete escalation analysis from story level through epic, PRD, trigger map, and fundamental business objectives to ensure comprehensive understanding of context and requirements before implementation.

## Purpose
Ensure professional development approach by understanding not just WHAT to build, but WHY it exists, WHO will use it, and HOW it fits within the broader business objectives and user experience.

- Map integration points with existing functionality
- Document any external dependencies or requirements
- Identify potential conflicts or coordination needs
- Plan implementation sequence based on dependencies

### 7. Context Validation and Gap Identification
- Validate complete understanding across all levels
- Identify any gaps in context or requirements
- Document questions or unclear requirements for escalation
- Confirm alignment between story requirements and broader objectives
- Flag any inconsistencies or potential conflicts

## Output Requirements
