# quality-gate-check

## Purpose

To perform comprehensive quality validation before marking any work complete, ensuring A+ WPS2C compliance grade and professional stakeholder experience. This task serves as the final checkpoint that prevents substandard documentation from being delivered.

## Process

The UX Expert systematically validates all aspects of documentation quality against WPS2C standards and professional presentation requirements before work completion.

### 1. WPS2C Compliance Validation

#### **Header Format Compliance Check**
- [ ] All scenario headers use exact **Previous Step**: ← format
- [ ] All scenario headers use exact **Next Step**: → format
- [ ] Mandatory double navigation pattern implemented (top line 1 and directly under image)
- [ ] Navigation text uses proper display names (not file names)
- [ ] Image paths include Sketches/ subfolder reference
- [ ] No deviations from WPS2C Zero Tolerance Policy

#### **Component Organization Validation**
- [ ] All components organized in proper atomic/molecular/organism structure
- [ ] No components remaining in flat or mixed organization
- [ ] Component classification follows atomic design principles correctly
- [ ] Folder hierarchy matches WPS2C standards exactly

#### **Path Format Compliance**
- [ ] All component references use absolute paths (/docs/D-Components/)
- [ ] No relative paths (../../D-Components/) that break GitHub web interface
- [ ] All component links functional in GitHub web viewer
- [ ] Path references consistent across all documentation

### 2. Documentation Standards Compliance

#### **Zero Tolerance Parentheses Policy**
- [ ] No parentheses used in documentation text
- [ ] Alternative formatting (dashes, colons, separate sentences) used appropriately
- [ ] Professional language standards maintained throughout
- [ ] Clear, unambiguous explanations without parenthetical demotions

#### **Title-Case-With-Dashes Naming**
- [ ] All folder names use Title-Case-With-Dashes format
- [ ] All file names follow URL-safe naming conventions
- [ ] No spaces, special characters, or case-sensitive issues
- [ ] Consistent naming across entire documentation structure

#### **Bilingual Content Standards**
- [ ] SE/EN content follows established project patterns
- [ ] Proper indentation and structure maintained
- [ ] Consistent bilingual formatting across all scenarios
- [ ] Professional presentation for Swedish corporate market

### 3. Component Linking Standards

#### **Component Reference Format Validation**
- [ ] Component headers use: `### [Component Name](/docs/D-Components/category/Component/Component.md)`
- [ ] Navigation lists use: `→ [Component Name](/docs/D-Components/category/Component/Component.md)`
- [ ] Referenced Components section present on every page with components
- [ ] Component linking patterns consistent throughout documentation

#### **Link Integrity Verification**
- [ ] All component links point to existing files
- [ ] No broken links or incorrect path references
- [ ] Component paths resolve correctly in GitHub web interface
- [ ] Cross-references between scenarios and components functional

### 4. Professional Presentation Standards

#### **Stakeholder Navigation Experience**
- [ ] Main documentation files immediately visible to project managers
- [ ] Navigation flow intuitive and consistent
- [ ] Professional appearance suitable for executive presentation
- [ ] Clear visual hierarchy and scannable content structure

#### **GitHub Web Interface Compatibility**
- [ ] All links functional in GitHub web viewer
- [ ] Component navigation works seamlessly
- [ ] Professional presentation maintained across platforms
- [ ] No 404 errors or broken navigation paths

#### **Enterprise Documentation Quality**
- [ ] Documentation meets enterprise standards for clarity and completeness
- [ ] Professional language and terminology used consistently
- [ ] Clear section organization and logical information flow
- [ ] Appropriate level of detail for stakeholder needs

### 5. Technical Implementation Readiness

#### **Development Handoff Quality**
- [ ] Component specifications complete and unambiguous
- [ ] Technical requirements clearly documented
- [ ] Implementation guidance sufficient for development teams
- [ ] Quality assurance criteria defined and testable

#### **Cross-Platform Consistency**
- [ ] Documentation works across all intended platforms and tools
- [ ] Consistent behavior in IDEs, web browsers, and documentation systems
- [ ] No platform-specific issues or compatibility problems
- [ ] Universal accessibility for all stakeholder types

### 6. Content Quality and Completeness

#### **Scenario Documentation Completeness**
- [ ] All scenario steps properly documented with sketches
- [ ] User journey flows complete and logical
- [ ] Business context and strategic alignment clear
- [ ] Component usage examples comprehensive and accurate

#### **Component Library Quality**
- [ ] All reusable components identified and documented
- [ ] Component specifications complete with all states and variants
- [ ] Usage guidelines clear and actionable
- [ ] Component relationships and dependencies documented

### 7. Quality Gate Decision Matrix

#### **Pass Criteria (A+ Grade)**
- All critical compliance checks pass (100%)
- All major quality standards met (95%+)
- Professional presentation standards achieved
- GitHub web interface fully functional
- Stakeholder navigation seamless

#### **Conditional Pass Criteria (A- to B+ Grade)**
- Critical compliance checks pass (100%)
- Major quality standards mostly met (85-94%)
- Minor issues documented for future resolution
- Core functionality intact

#### **Fail Criteria (Below B+ Grade)**
- Any critical compliance violations exist
- Major quality standards not met (<85%)
- Broken navigation or functionality
- Unprofessional presentation issues

### 8. Quality Gate Report Generation

#### **Comprehensive Quality Assessment**
Generate detailed report including:
- **Overall Quality Grade**: A+ to F scale with specific score
- **Compliance Status**: Pass/Fail for each validation category
- **Issue Summary**: Any remaining violations or quality concerns
- **Stakeholder Impact**: Assessment of professional presentation quality
- **Recommendation**: Proceed/Fix Issues/Major Revision needed

#### **Actionable Improvement Plan**
For any issues identified:
- **Priority Level**: Critical/Major/Minor classification
- **Specific Location**: File and line number references
- **Required Fix**: Exact correction needed
- **Impact Assessment**: Effect on stakeholder experience
- **Remediation Command**: Specific agent command to resolve issue

## Output

A comprehensive quality gate report that includes:
- **Quality Gate Decision**: Pass/Conditional Pass/Fail determination
- **Detailed Compliance Assessment**: Complete validation results
- **Professional Presentation Evaluation**: Stakeholder experience quality
- **Technical Readiness Confirmation**: Development handoff preparedness
- **Improvement Recommendations**: Specific actions for any identified issues

## Integration with Whiteport Workflow

### **Work Completion Protocol**
- MANDATORY execution before marking any work complete
- Prevents delivery of substandard documentation
- Ensures consistent A+ quality across all deliverables

### **Stakeholder Confidence**
- Guarantees professional presentation for all audiences
- Ensures seamless navigation experience
- Maintains enterprise-grade documentation standards

### **Continuous Quality Improvement**
- Identifies patterns in quality issues
- Informs process improvements and training needs
- Maintains documentation excellence over project lifecycle

## Best Practices

### **Systematic Validation**
- Follow quality gate checklist methodically
- Document all findings with specific evidence
- Provide clear pass/fail determination with rationale

### **Stakeholder Focus**
