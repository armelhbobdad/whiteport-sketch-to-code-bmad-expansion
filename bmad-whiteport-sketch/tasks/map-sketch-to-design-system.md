# Map Sketch to Design System

## Purpose

To systematically map identified sketch components to the existing design system, ensuring seamless integration and consistency across the project. This process enables designers to leverage existing design tokens, components, and patterns while identifying opportunities for enhancement.

## WPS2C Method Vision

**Providing a thinking partner to every designer on the planet** - enabling designers everywhere to give more of what is valuable to the world. With deep understanding of users, technology, and what drives people, we provide functionality, beauty, simplicity, and make software endlessly successful by giving people both what they want and what they need.

This mapping process is a core component of that vision - helping designers systematically integrate their creative work with existing design systems for maximum efficiency and consistency.
