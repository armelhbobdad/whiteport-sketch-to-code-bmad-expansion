# create-user-scenarios

## Purpose

To create compelling, unbroken user journey narratives that demonstrate the shortest and most efficient path for users to achieve their goals while simultaneously delivering value to business objectives. These scenarios serve as the storytelling foundation that enables all project stakeholders to follow the logical progression of user interactions through the application.

## Process

The PM will analyze the completed Product Brief and Trigger Map to craft comprehensive user journey stories that show complete end-to-end flows with clear cause-and-effect relationships.

### Foundation Analysis

* **Product Brief Review**: Extract user types, business goals, and core value propositions
* **Trigger Map Analysis**: Identify user driving forces and business goal connections
* **Value Flow Mapping**: Understand how user actions create mutual value for both user and business

### Scenario Development Principles

* **Unbroken Chain Storytelling**: Present complete user journeys as continuous narratives without gaps
* **Shortest Path to Value**: Focus on the most efficient route for users to achieve their goals
* **Dual Value Creation**: Show how each user action contributes to both user success and business objectives
* **Stakeholder Accessibility**: Keep scenarios concrete and followable by anyone on the project team

### Create Core User Journey Stories

For each primary user type from the trigger map, develop 2-3 core scenarios that:

* **Start from Real Context**: Begin with authentic user motivation and situation
* **Show Logical Progression**: Each step naturally follows from the previous action
* **Highlight Value Exchange**: Make explicit how user actions benefit both parties
* **End with Clear Outcomes**: Demonstrate goal achievement and business value creation

### Documentation Structure

Create the scenarios document at `Docs/C. Scenarios/00-scenarios.md` using the scenarios template with:

* **Scenario Overview**: Summary of all user journey stories
* **Individual Journey Narratives**: Detailed step-by-step flow for each scenario
* **Value Flow Analysis**: How user actions map to business goal achievement
* **Cross-Scenario Connections**: How different journeys might intersect or build upon each other

## Output

A comprehensive scenarios document that serves as the narrative foundation for:
* UX Expert sketching sessions
* Development team understanding
* Stakeholder alignment
* Feature prioritization decisions

## Validation Questions

1. **Continuity Check**: "Can anyone on the team follow the complete user journey without gaps or confusion?"
2. **Efficiency Validation**: "Is this truly the shortest path for the user to achieve their goal?"
3. **Value Alignment**: "Is it clear how each user action contributes to business objectives?"
4. **Story Completeness**: "Does each scenario tell a complete story from motivation to outcome?"

## Success Criteria

* **Complete User Journeys**: Every scenario shows end-to-end flow without logical gaps
* **Clear Value Exchange**: Business value creation is explicit in each user action
* **Stakeholder Understanding**: Non-technical team members can follow and understand all scenarios
* **Development Readiness**: Scenarios provide sufficient detail for sketching and development planning
* **Trigger Map Alignment**: All scenarios directly support user driving forces and business goals identified in the trigger map

## Next Steps

Once scenarios are validated:
* UX Expert uses scenarios for structured sketching sessions
* PM creates backend epics based on scenario technical requirements
* Development team uses scenarios for sprint planning and feature prioritization
