# Discuss Component Structure

**Task**: Discuss and plan D-Design-System structure with user before creating folders  
**Agent**: whiteport-ux-expert  
**Phase**: Conceptual Design & Sketching  
**Priority**: High

## Task Overview

The UX Expert should discuss the D-Design-System structure with the user before creating any folders. This ensures the component system matches the project's actual needs and gets user approval.

## Prerequisites

- Project has completed A-Product-Brief and B-Trigger-Map phases
- Conceptual design phase has begun
- User is ready to discuss component structure
- C-Scenarios structure has been discussed (if applicable)

## Dialog Process

### **Step 1: Analyze Component Needs**
1. **Review Existing Sketches**: Examine what components are referenced in sketches
2. **Review Existing Components**: Check what components already exist in `/components/ui/`
3. **Identify Component Types**: Determine what atomic, molecular, organism components are needed
4. **Prepare Discussion Points**: Ready to discuss component categories

### **Step 2: Present Component Options**
1. **Show Generic Structure**: Present example D-Design-System folder structure
2. **Explain Categories**: Explain what each component category would contain
3. **Ask for Input**: Ask user what components they need for their project
4. **Listen to Requirements**: Understand user's specific component needs

### **Step 3: Discuss Customization**
1. **Component Categories**: Discuss what component categories make sense
2. **Naming Conventions**: Discuss appropriate naming for their project
3. **Content Structure**: Discuss what content goes in each component
4. **Integration**: Discuss how components connect to scenarios

### **Step 4: Get User Approval**
1. **Present Final Structure**: Show proposed structure based on discussion
2. **Confirm Categories**: Get user approval for component categories
3. **Confirm Naming**: Get user approval for naming conventions
4. **Confirm Content**: Get user approval for content structure

### **Step 5: Create Structure (Only After Approval)**
1. **Create D-Design-System Folder**: Main design system directory
2. **Create Component Folders**: Only approved component categories
3. **Create Content Structure**: Only approved content structure
4. **Document Decisions**: Record what was decided and why

## Dialog Guidelines

### **For UX Expert**
- **Listen First**: Understand user's component needs before suggesting structure
- **Ask Questions**: Clarify requirements and preferences
- **Present Options**: Show different structure possibilities
- **Get Approval**: Never create folders without user approval

### **For User**
- **Be Specific**: Explain what components you need for your project
- **Ask Questions**: Clarify any confusion about structure options
- **Provide Feedback**: Give input on proposed structure
- **Make Decisions**: Approve structure before creation

## Example Dialog Flow

### **UX Expert**: "Let's discuss the D-Design-System structure for your project. Based on your sketches, I can see you need components for [specific component needs]. What component categories do you think would work best for your project?"

### **User**: "I need components for [user's specific needs]"

### **UX Expert**: "Great! Based on your needs, I suggest this structure: [present structure]. Does this make sense for your project? Would you like to modify any categories?"

### **User**: "Yes, that looks good, but I'd like to change [specific modifications]"

### **UX Expert**: "Perfect! So the final structure will be [final structure]. Should I create these folders now?"

### **User**: "Yes, please create the structure"

## Success Criteria

### **User Approval**
- [ ] User understands the proposed structure
- [ ] User has provided input on their needs
- [ ] User has approved the final structure
- [ ] User is ready for folder creation

### **Structure Quality**
- [ ] Structure matches project needs
- [ ] Naming conventions are appropriate
- [ ] Content structure is clear
- [ ] Integration with scenarios is planned
