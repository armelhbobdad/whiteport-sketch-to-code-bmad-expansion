## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Interview Pitfalls
- [ ] Don't rush the interview process - take time to understand designer needs
- [ ] Don't assume designer preferences - ask specific questions
- [ ] Don't skip project context discussion - market and user requirements matter
- [ ] Don't ignore development team considerations - implementation matters

### Decision Process Pitfalls
- [ ] Don't skip the decision matrix - systematic evaluation prevents poor choices
- [ ] Don't ignore designer input - they're the primary user of the design system
- [ ] Don't choose based on personal preference - base decision on project requirements
- [ ] Don't skip alternative consideration - always consider close alternatives

### Documentation Pitfalls
- [ ] Don't skip rationale documentation - future team members need to understand the choice
- [ ] Don't skip implementation planning - design system needs to be properly integrated
- [ ] Don't skip guidelines creation - designer and developer guidelines prevent confusion
- [ ] Don't skip WPS2C integration planning - design system must enhance the workflow

## Next Steps

After completing design system selection:

1. **Update WPS2C Workflow**: Integrate design system selection into Phase 1-3
2. **Update Agent Instructions**: Add design system selection to PM and Analyst agents
3. **Create Implementation Guide**: Guide for implementing selected design system
4. **Update Templates**: Include design system considerations in all relevant templates
5. **Test Integration**: Validate design system selection enhances WPS2C workflow
