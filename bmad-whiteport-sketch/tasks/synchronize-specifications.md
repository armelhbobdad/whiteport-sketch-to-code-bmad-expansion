# Synchronize Specifications Task

## Purpose
Maintain perfect alignment between code implementation and specifications when changes are needed during development, ensuring living documentation accuracy throughout the WPS2C development process.

## When to Use
- When implementation reveals missing requirements not captured in specifications
- When designer requests changes during development that affect specifications
- When technical constraints require adjustments to planned functionality
- When implementation details need to be documented for future reference

## Collaborative Partnership Protocol

### Step 1: Identify Specification Changes Needed
- Document what changed during implementation compared to original specifications
- Identify specific sections of specifications that need updates
- Note any new requirements discovered during development
- List any technical constraints that affected original design intent

### Step 2: Present Changes to Designer
- **NEVER update specifications unilaterally**
- Present proposed specification changes to designer for approval
- Explain technical rationale for any constraint-driven changes
- Confirm understanding of design intent before proceeding

### Step 3: Collaborative Specification Update
- Update specifications WITH designer approval and input
- Ensure changes maintain design intent and user experience goals
- Update both functional specifications AND technical implementation notes
- Maintain consistency across all related specification documents

### Step 4: Verify Code-Specification Alignment
- Confirm implemented code matches updated specifications exactly
- Update any code comments to reflect specification changes
- Ensure no drift between documentation and implementation
- Validate that specifications remain accurate for future development

### Step 5: Cross-Reference Documentation Updates
- Update any related documents that reference changed specifications
- Maintain cross-reference accuracy across project documentation
- Ensure PRD, backlog, and ticket references remain aligned
- Update any architectural documentation affected by changes

## Critical Success Factors

✅ **Designer Approval Required**: No specification changes without designer confirmation  
✅ **Bidirectional Updates**: Both code AND specifications updated in sync  
✅ **Living Documentation**: Specifications remain accurate and current  
✅ **Design Intent Preservation**: Changes maintain original user experience goals  
✅ **Future Developer Support**: Updated specifications guide future development accurately
