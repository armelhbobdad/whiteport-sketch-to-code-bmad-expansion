# Sketching From Scratch

## Purpose

To facilitate collaborative design thinking when no sketch exists, integrating trigger map psychology, customer awareness cycle, and the golden rule to suggest presentation sections, content, interactive parts, features and forms that propel the user forward towards the goal defined in the scenario.

## WPS2C Method Vision

**Providing a thinking partner to every designer on the planet** - enabling designers everywhere to give more of what is valuable to the world. With deep understanding of users, technology, and what drives people, we provide functionality, beauty, simplicity, and make software endlessly successful by giving people both what they want and what they need.

This collaborative design thinking process is a core component of that vision - helping designers discover the best solutions through systematic integration of user psychology, business goals, and design principles.

**Facilitate:**
1. "Let's work through this step by step, starting from the user's perspective"
2. "What does the user see when they first arrive at this step?"
3. "What are they thinking and feeling at this moment?"
4. "What actions do they need to take to move forward?"

#### Step 2.2: Presentation Sections Suggestion
**Suggest:**
- **Hero Section**: Primary value proposition and emotional connection
- **Features Section**: Core functionality that serves user needs
- **Social Proof**: Testimonials, reviews, or trust indicators
- **FAQ Section**: Address common concerns and objections
- **Call-to-Action**: Clear next step for user progression

#### Step 2.3: Content Strategy Development
**Develop:**
- **Headlines**: Emotional triggers and value propositions
- **Copy**: Supporting text that builds confidence and clarity
- **Emotional Triggers**: Language that connects with user motivations
- **Urgency Elements**: Reasons to act now rather than later
- **Benefit Focus**: What user gains from taking action

#### Step 2.4: Interactive Parts Identification
**Identify:**
- **Primary Buttons**: Main actions user needs to take
- **Secondary Buttons**: Alternative or supporting actions
- **Forms**: Data collection that advances user journey
- **Navigation**: How user moves through interface
- **Feedback Elements**: How user understands system responses

#### Step 2.5: Features and Functionality
**Define:**
- **Core Features**: Essential functionality for user success
- **Supporting Features**: Additional value that enhances experience
- **User Input Requirements**: What information user needs to provide
- **System Responses**: How system acknowledges and processes user actions
- **Progress Indicators**: How user understands their journey progress

### Output
- Complete solution framework with all necessary elements
- Clear content strategy and messaging approach
- Defined interactive elements and user flows
- Comprehensive feature set that serves user goals

## Phase 3: Energy Capture

### Purpose
Encourage immediate sketching while solution clarity is fresh and energy is high.

### Process

#### Step 3.1: Energy Recognition
**Acknowledge:**
- "We've developed a clear solution framework"
- "The user journey and elements are well-defined"
- "This is the perfect moment to capture this energy"

#### Step 3.2: Sketching Encouragement
**Encourage:**
- "Now that we have clarity, let's capture this energy in sketches"
- "Start sketching immediately while the solution is fresh"
- "Don't worry about perfection - we'll refine as we go"
- "Focus on the key elements we just identified"

#### Step 3.3: Sketching Focus Areas
**Guide Focus:**
- **Primary Layout**: Overall page structure and flow
- **Key Sections**: Hero, features, social proof, CTA
- **Interactive Elements**: Buttons, forms, navigation
- **Content Hierarchy**: Headlines, copy, visual elements
- **User Flow**: How user moves through the interface

#### Step 3.4: Sketching Support
**Provide:**
- **Reference Materials**: Design system components and patterns
- **Layout Suggestions**: Common patterns for similar interfaces
- **Content Placeholders**: Suggested text and messaging
- **Visual Guidelines**: Brand elements and styling considerations

### Output
