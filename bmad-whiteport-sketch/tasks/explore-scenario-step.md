# Scenario Step Exploration

## Purpose

To facilitate collaborative design thinking when no sketch exists, integrating trigger map psychology, customer awareness cycle, and the golden rule to discover the best solution through thoughtful partnership and guided exploration.

## WPS2C Method Vision

**Providing a thinking partner to every designer on the planet** - enabling designers everywhere to give more of what is valuable to the world. With deep understanding of users, technology, and what drives people, we provide functionality, beauty, simplicity, and make software endlessly successful by giving people both what they want and what they need.

This exploration process is a core component of that vision - helping designers discover the best solutions through collaborative thinking, not just document generation.

## Core Philosophy

- **Thinking Partnership** - Be a collaborative thinking partner, not just a document generator
- **Guided Discovery** - Ask questions and explore together rather than dictating solutions
- **Business-User Value Integration** - Start with business goals and ensure maximum value for both business and users
- **Trigger Map Integration** - Apply user personas and driving forces to guide design decisions
- **Customer Awareness Cycle** - Apply Eugene Schwartz's awareness model to adapt messaging to user's awareness level
- **Golden Rule Application** - Apply Why → What → How framework to every section for maximum business and user value
- **Energy Capture** - Encourage immediate sketching while solution clarity is fresh
- **Comprehensive Content Creation** - Write all text content developers need including headlines, labels, messages, and translations

## Phase 1: Context Integration

### Purpose
Integrate trigger map psychology, customer awareness cycle, and previous scenario context to establish design foundation through collaborative exploration.

### Process

#### Step 1.1: Business Goal and User Value Integration
**Explore Together:**
- "Let's start with the business goal. What is the primary business objective this scenario step needs to achieve?"
- "Which persona from our trigger map is this step primarily serving, and how do their needs align with our business goal?"
- "How can we create maximum value for both the business and the user in this step?"
- "What would make this a win-win scenario where both the business achieves its goal and the user gets significant value?"

#### Step 1.2: Customer Awareness Cycle Integration
**Guide Through Discovery:**
- "Let's think about the user's awareness level. Are they problem-aware, solution-aware, or product-aware?"
- "What stage of Eugene Schwartz's awareness cycle are they in - unaware, problem-aware, solution-aware, product-aware, or most-aware?"
- "How should our messaging adapt to match their current awareness level?"
- "What information do they need at this specific awareness stage to move forward?"

#### Step 1.3: Golden Rule Application
**Explore Together:**
- "Let's apply the Golden Rule to every section we design. For each element, we need to answer Why, What, and How."
- "Why should this section exist? What business value does it create?"
- "What content will make it attractive to users so they get real value from it?"
- "How should it be implemented to create maximum impact for both user and business?"

#### Step 1.4: Previous Scenario Context
**Consider Together:**
- "What do you think happened in the previous steps that brought them here?"
- "What's their current state of mind and what expectations have we set?"
- "What information have we already provided that we can build upon?"
- "How can we maintain continuity while moving them forward?"

### Output
- Shared understanding of user psychology and motivations
- Clear progression through customer awareness cycle
- Established golden rule compliance framework
- Contextual foundation for solution discovery

## Phase 2: Collaborative Solution Discovery

### Purpose
Work together to discover the best solution through thoughtful exploration and collaborative thinking.

### Process

#### Step 2.1: User Perspective Foundation
**Explore Together:**
- "Let's work through this step by step from the user's perspective. What do you think they see when they first arrive?"
- "What's going through their mind at this moment? What are they thinking and feeling?"
- "What do you think they need to understand to feel confident about taking action?"
- "What would make this feel easy and natural for them?"

#### Step 2.2: Presentation Sections Discovery
**Discover Together:**
- "What do you think would be the most compelling way to introduce this step to the user?"
- "What sections do you think would help them understand the value and feel confident?"
- "How might we address their concerns or objections right up front?"
- "What would make them trust us and want to move forward?"

**Explore Options:**
- **Hero Section**: "What do you think would be the most powerful headline and visual?"
- **Features Section**: "What functionality do you think would serve their needs best?"
- **Social Proof**: "What kind of testimonials or trust indicators would resonate with them?"
- **FAQ Section**: "What questions do you think they might have that we should address?"

#### Step 2.3: Content Strategy Development
**Develop Together:**
- "What tone and voice do you think would connect with this user?"
- "What emotional triggers do you think would motivate them to act?"
- "What specific words or phrases do you think would resonate with them?"
- "How can we make this feel personal and relevant to their situation?"

**Content Creation for Developers:**
- "Let's write all the content developers will need - headlines, body text, button labels, form labels"
- "What warning messages and error states do we need to plan for?"
- "What success messages and confirmations should we include?"
- "What placeholder text and help text will guide users through the experience?"

#### Step 2.4: Interactive Elements Discovery
**Discover Together:**
- "What do you think should be the primary action they take?"
- "What alternative actions might they want to explore?"
- "What information do you think they need to provide to move forward?"
- "How can we make their interactions feel smooth and intuitive?"

#### Step 2.5: Features and Functionality Exploration
**Explore Together:**
- "What core functionality do you think is essential for their success?"
- "What additional features might enhance their experience?"
- "What do you think they need to input or configure?"
- "How can we give them feedback that builds confidence?"

#### Step 2.6: Comprehensive Content Creation
**Create Together:**
- "Let's write all the text content developers will need for each component and section"
- "What are the exact headlines, subheadings, and body text for each section?"
- "What button labels, form labels, and interactive element text do we need?"
- "What error messages, warning messages, and validation text should we include?"
- "What success messages, confirmations, and feedback text will guide users?"
- "What placeholder text, help text, and tooltips will support the user experience?"
- "What loading states, empty states, and edge case messaging do we need?"
- "How should all this content be structured for easy translation to Swedish and English?"

### Output
- Complete solution framework discovered through collaboration
- Clear content strategy and messaging approach
- Defined interactive elements and user flows
- Comprehensive feature set that serves user goals
- Complete text content for developers including headlines, labels, messages, and translations

## Phase 3: Energy Capture and Sketching

### Purpose
Encourage immediate sketching while solution clarity is fresh and energy is high.

### Process

#### Step 3.1: Energy Recognition
**Acknowledge Together:**
- "We've developed a really clear solution framework together. How does this feel to you?"
- "I can sense the energy and clarity we've built. This is the perfect moment to capture it."
- "What aspects of what we've discovered are you most excited about?"

#### Step 3.2: Sketching Encouragement
**Encourage Together:**
- "Now that we have this clarity, let's capture this energy in sketches. What do you think?"
- "I'd love to see how you envision this solution. Don't worry about perfection - we can refine as we go."
- "What elements are you most excited to sketch first?"

#### Step 3.3: Sketching Focus Areas
**Guide Focus Together:**
- "What do you think should be the overall layout and flow?"
- "Which sections do you want to start with - the hero, features, or something else?"
- "How do you envision the interactive elements working?"
- "What visual hierarchy feels right to you?"

#### Step 3.4: Sketching Support
**Support Together:**
- "I'm here to think through any challenges as you sketch."
- "What questions come up as you're drawing this out?"
- "How does this feel as you're putting it on paper?"
- "What adjustments are you making as you sketch?"

### Output
- High-energy sketching session with collaborative support
- Sketches that capture the discovered solution framework
- Foundation for detailed specification and component creation

## Phase 4: Next Steps Planning

### Purpose
Plan next steps for developing sketches into detailed specifications through continued collaboration.

### Process

#### Step 4.1: Sketch Review
**Review Together:**
- "Let's look at what we've created together. What are you most pleased with?"
- "What elements emerged that you didn't expect?"
- "How well do you think these sketches serve the user's goals?"
- "What would you like to refine or explore further?"

#### Step 4.2: Component Identification
**Identify Together:**
- "I can see several components we'll need to specify. What do you think?"
- "Which elements do you think could be reusable across other scenarios?"
- "How do you envision these fitting into our atomic design structure?"
- "What design system elements do you think we can leverage?"

#### Step 4.3: Specification Planning
**Plan Together:**
- "Next, we'll create detailed specifications for each component. What's your preference for how we approach this?"
- "How would you like to map these to our existing design system?"
- "What copy and translations do you think we'll need?"
- "How can we ensure everything follows our WPS2C standards?"

#### Step 4.4: Implementation Roadmap
**Create Together:**
- "Here's how I think we can move from sketches to working components. What do you think?"
- "Which elements do you think are most critical to start with?"
- "How can we maintain this energy and clarity as we build toward implementation?"
- "What support do you need to keep this momentum going?"

### Output
