# create-product-brief

## Purpose

To guide the creation of a foundational product brief that establishes project vision, strategic direction, and high-level requirements. The product brief serves as the foundation for subsequent trigger map analysis, persona development, and PRD creation.

## Process

**CRITICAL: This is a COLLABORATIVE DISCOVERY process. The Analyst must be enthusiastic, helpful, and non-judgmental. Always offer to skip questions and provide suggestions if users struggle.**

The Analyst will work with the user to create an initial product brief that defines the project's strategic foundation. This document will guide the creation of detailed user research (trigger map and personas) and technical requirements.

### Step 0: Foundational Project Discovery
**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Start with open-ended discovery, then use adaptive follow-up questions.

#### Opening Discovery
**Start with**: "Can you describe the project you're working on in your own words?"

#### Adaptive Follow-up Questions
*Use these to fill gaps from their initial description. For each question, offer to skip and provide helpful suggestions if they struggle.*

**Supportive approach**: "No worries if you're not sure about this - we can come back to it later, or I can suggest some options if that would help!"

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS**:
- **One question at a time**: Never ask multiple questions simultaneously
- **Progressive brief building**: Update the brief document after each user response
- **Positive reflection**: Respond positively and insightfully to each answer before updating the brief
- **Connect information**: Reference and build on previous answers throughout the conversation
- **Progress indicators**: Use encouraging language like "Only a few more questions," "We're almost there"
- **Skip financial questions**: Avoid budget/resource questions in foundational discovery
- **Varied update language**: Change how you announce brief updates - "I'll add this insight," "Let me capture this," etc.
- **Encourage review**: After discovery, ask user to read the brief and provide feedback

##### Project Context & Nature
- "What do you call your users? Is there one or more names for them?" *(Skip for now?)*
  - *If stuck: "For example, some call them users, customers, members, subscribers, patients, students - what feels right for your context?"*
- "What kind of IT product or products are you working on?" *(Skip for now?)*
  - *If stuck: "Like a mobile app, web platform, internal system, API, integration - or maybe something hybrid?"*
- "Are these existing or new projects?" (Greenfield vs Brownfield) *(Skip for now?)*
  - *If stuck: "Are you building something completely new, or improving/expanding something that already exists?"*
- "Is this a standalone product or part of a larger system/ecosystem?" *(Skip for now?)*
  - *If stuck: "Does this need to connect with other systems, or can it work independently?"*

##### Organizational Context
- "Who are the key stakeholders and decision-makers for this project?" *(Skip for now?)*
  - *If stuck: "Like product owners, business sponsors, technical leads, end-user representatives?"*
- "What's driving the need for this product/improvement right now?" *(Skip for now?)*
  - *If stuck: "Is it a business opportunity, solving a current problem, regulatory requirement, or competitive pressure?"*
- "What's your timeline expectation - is this urgent, planned, or exploratory?" *(Skip for now?)*
  - *If stuck: "Are you under time pressure, following a planned roadmap, or still figuring out if this should be built?"*
- "What resources do you have available - team size, budget range, technical constraints?" *(Skip for now?)*
  - *If stuck: "Just rough ideas - small team vs large, limited budget vs well-funded, any technical limitations?"*

##### Market & Competitive Context
- "Do you have existing competitors or similar solutions in the market?" *(Skip for now?)*
  - *If stuck: "Are there other products that do something similar, or would this be pretty unique?"*
- "How do users currently solve this problem today, if at all?" *(Skip for now?)*
  - *If stuck: "Do they use workarounds, manual processes, other tools, or just live with the problem?"*
- "What makes your approach different or necessary?" *(Skip for now?)*
  - *If stuck: "What would make this better than current solutions, or why is it needed if nothing exists?"*

##### Success & Measurement Context
- "How will you know if this project is successful?" *(Skip for now?)*
  - *If stuck: "Think about what success would look like - more users, cost savings, process improvements?"*
- "What would failure look like for this project?" *(Skip for now?)*
  - *If stuck: "What outcomes would make you think this wasn't worth building?"*
- "Are there specific business metrics or KPIs you need to impact?" *(Skip for now?)*
  - *If stuck: "Like revenue, user engagement, operational efficiency, compliance - any particular numbers to move?"*

##### Technical & Platform Context
- "Do you have existing technical infrastructure this needs to integrate with?" *(Skip for now?)*
  - *If stuck: "Existing databases, APIs, authentication systems, or can this be completely independent?"*
- "Are there specific platforms, technologies, or standards you must use?" *(Skip for now?)*
  - *If stuck: "Company standards, regulatory requirements, or team expertise that limits technology choices?"*
- "Who will be maintaining and operating this product long-term?" *(Skip for now?)*
  - *If stuck: "Your team, a different team, external vendor, or still to be determined?"*

**STOP HERE** - Wait for user responses and use their answers to inform all subsequent product brief sections.

**IMPORTANT**: After foundational discovery, the Analyst should proactively create product brief sections based on the gathered information. Unlike the trigger map process, do NOT continue step-by-step elicitation. Create content directly and allow user to review and provide feedback for iterations.

### 1. Executive Summary Creation
- **Project Overview**: Name, core problem, solution approach in 2-3 sentences
- **Target Market**: Primary market segment based on initial market understanding
- **Key Value Proposition**: How the solution addresses anticipated user needs
- **Business Context**: High-level business visions and strategic direction

### 2. Key Assumptions (Prominent Placement)
- **Business Assumptions**: Budget authority, market willingness, purchasing decisions
- **Technical Assumptions**: Development approach (AI-first, platform choices, timeline)
- **User Assumptions**: Persona engagement patterns, behavior expectations
- **Format**: Clear bullet list placed prominently after executive summary

### 3. Problem Statement Development
- **Current State**: Pain points identified through initial discovery and stakeholder input
- **Impact Quantification**: Establish measurable business impact goals
- **Urgency Drivers**: Why this problem needs solving now
- **Source Material**: Stakeholder interviews, market research, business needs

### 4. Solution Overview
- **Core Concept**: High-level approach addressing anticipated user needs
