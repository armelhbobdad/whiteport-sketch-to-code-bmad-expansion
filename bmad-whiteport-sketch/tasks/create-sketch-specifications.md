# Create Sketch Specifications

## Purpose

To create detailed, implementation-ready specifications from completed sketches that follow WPS2C standards and enable seamless development handoff. This process transforms creative sketching work into actionable technical specifications.

## WPS2C Method Vision

**Providing a thinking partner to every designer on the planet** - enabling designers everywhere to give more of what is valuable to the world. With deep understanding of users, technology, and what drives people, we provide functionality, beauty, simplicity, and make software endlessly successful by giving people both what they want and what they need.

This specification creation process is a core component of that vision - helping designers transform their creative work into implementable solutions that serve both user needs and business goals.

## Core Philosophy

- **Implementation Ready** - Create specifications that developers can immediately implement
- **WPS2C Compliance** - Follow all WPS2C documentation standards and naming conventions
- **User-Centered Specifications** - Focus on user needs and business goals in all specifications
- **Design System Integration** - Ensure specifications integrate with existing design system
- **Quality Assurance** - Maintain high quality standards throughout specification creation
