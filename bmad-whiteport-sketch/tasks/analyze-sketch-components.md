# Analyze Sketch Components

## Purpose

To systematically analyze existing sketches to identify atomic, molecular, and organism components that can be integrated into the design system. This process enables designers to discover reusable components from their sketching work and build a comprehensive component library.

## WPS2C Method Vision

**Providing a thinking partner to every designer on the planet** - enabling designers everywhere to give more of what is valuable to the world. With deep understanding of users, technology, and what drives people, we provide functionality, beauty, simplicity, and make software endlessly successful by giving people both what they want and what they need.

This component analysis process is a core component of that vision - helping designers systematically discover and document reusable components from their creative work.

## Core Philosophy

- **Systematic Discovery** - Methodically identify components from sketches using atomic design principles
- **Reusability Focus** - Identify components that can be reused across scenarios and projects
- **Design System Integration** - Map discovered components to existing design system structure
- **User-Centered Analysis** - Focus on components that serve user needs and business goals
- **Implementation Ready** - Ensure all identified components are ready for development

## Process Overview

### Phase 1: Sketch Review
### Phase 2: Atomic Component Identification
### Phase 3: Molecular Component Discovery
### Phase 4: Organism Component Analysis

### Process

#### Step 1.1: Sketch Inventory
**Review:**
1. All sketches in current scenario
2. Sketches from related scenarios
3. Previous sketching sessions

5. Component exploration sketches

#### Step 1.2: Sketch Categorization
**Categorize:**
- **Primary Sketches**: Main scenario interface sketches
- **Component Sketches**: Focused component exploration sketches
- **Reference Sketches**: Design system and inspiration sketches
- **Iteration Sketches**: Refinement and alternative sketches

#### Step 1.3: Analysis Scope Definition
**Define:**
- **Analysis Focus**: [Specific components or interface areas to analyze]
- **Reusability Goals**: [Components that should be reusable across scenarios]
- **Design System Integration**: [How components fit into existing design system]
- **Implementation Priorities**: [Which components are most critical for development]

### Output
- Complete sketch inventory and categorization
- Clear analysis scope and focus areas
- Defined reusability and integration goals

5. **Colors**: Primary, secondary, accent, neutral color usage
6. **Spacing**: Margins, padding, gaps, alignment patterns

#### Step 2.2: Atomic Component Analysis
**Analyze:**
- **Visual Properties**: Size, color, typography, spacing
- **Interactive States**: Default, hover, active, disabled, focus
- **Variants**: Different sizes, colors, styles
- **Usage Patterns**: How and where components are used
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation

#### Step 2.3: Atomic Component Documentation
**Document:**
- Component name and purpose
