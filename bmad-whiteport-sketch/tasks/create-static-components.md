# Task: Create Static React Components

## Overview
This task guides the UX Expert through creating static React components that match hand-drawn sketches using the selected design system. These components serve as the bridge between design and development, providing concrete implementation targets.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Design System Integration Setup
**UX Expert Action**: Set up design system integration for static component creation
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes
**Prerequisites**: Design system selection completed, sketches available

**Setup Checklist**:
- [ ] Verify selected design system is documented
- [ ] Install design system packages if needed
- [ ] Set up component folder structure in Frontend/
- [ ] Create base theme configuration
- [ ] Prepare component templates

### Step 2: Sketch Analysis and Component Mapping
**UX Expert Action**: Analyze sketches and map elements to design system components
**Duration**: 20-30 minutes
**Participants**: UX Expert + Designer

**Analysis Process**:
1. **Sketch Review** (10 minutes)
   - Review hand-drawn sketches for each page
   - Identify key interface elements and patterns
   - Note responsive requirements and states
   - Document interaction patterns

2. **Component Mapping** (10 minutes)
   - Map sketch elements to design system components
   - Identify atomic, molecular, and organism components
   - Plan component composition and hierarchy
   - Document component relationships

3. **Design System Integration** (10 minutes)
   - Select appropriate design system components
   - Plan theme customizations for brand consistency
   - Identify missing components that need custom creation
   - Plan responsive behavior using design system breakpoints

### Step 3: Static Component Creation
**UX Expert Action**: Create static React components matching sketches
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes per page
**Output**: Static React components in Frontend/ folder

**Component Creation Process**:
1. **Page Component Structure** (10 minutes)
   - Create main page component using design system layout
   - Set up component hierarchy and composition
   - Apply basic theme configuration
   - Add placeholder content matching sketches

2. **Atomic Components** (10 minutes)
   - Create buttons, inputs, text elements
   - Use design system components as foundation
   - Apply brand-specific styling
   - Ensure accessibility compliance

3. **Molecular Components** (10 minutes)
   - Create form fields, cards, navigation elements
   - Compose atomic components into functional units
   - Add interaction states and hover effects
   - Implement responsive behavior

4. **Organism Components** (10 minutes)
   - Create complex sections like headers, sidebars, content areas
   - Integrate molecular components into complete sections
   - Add page-level interactions and state management
   - Ensure component reusability

5. **Page Integration** (5 minutes)
   - Integrate all components into complete page
   - Test component composition and layout
   - Verify responsive behavior
   - Add basic navigation between pages

### Step 4: Component Documentation
**UX Expert Action**: Document static components for development handoff
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes
**Output**: Component documentation and usage examples

**Documentation Requirements**:
- [ ] Component API documentation
- [ ] Props and state definitions
- [ ] Usage examples and code snippets
- [ ] Design system integration notes
- [ ] Responsive behavior documentation
- [ ] Accessibility compliance notes

## Elicitation

### Designer Collaboration Questions

**Sketch Analysis**:
- "Can you walk me through the key elements in this sketch?"
- "What are the most important interactions on this page?"
- "Are there any responsive states or breakpoints I should consider?"
- "Which elements should be reusable components vs page-specific?"

**Design System Integration**:
- "How should we customize the design system for our brand?"
- "Are there any design system components that don't fit our needs?"
- "What level of customization do you need for each component?"
- "Should we create custom components for unique elements?"

**Component Structure**:
- "How should we organize components in the Frontend folder?"
- "Which components should be shared across multiple pages?"
- "What naming convention should we use for components?"
- "How detailed should the component documentation be?"

### Technical Implementation Questions

**Design System Setup**:
- "What's the selected design system for this project?"
- "Are there any specific theme customizations needed?"
- "Should we use TypeScript for component definitions?"
- "What testing framework should we use for components?"

**Component Architecture**:
- "How should we structure component props and state?"
- "Should we use CSS-in-JS or separate stylesheets?"
- "How should we handle component theming and customization?"
- "What's the preferred component composition pattern?"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Component Creation Pitfalls
- [ ] Don't skip design system integration - use selected system consistently
- [ ] Don't create components without proper structure - follow atomic design
- [ ] Don't ignore responsive requirements - implement breakpoints correctly
- [ ] Don't skip accessibility - maintain design system accessibility features

### Design System Integration Pitfalls
- [ ] Don't override design system unnecessarily - use theme customization
- [ ] Don't ignore design system patterns - follow established conventions
- [ ] Don't skip documentation - document design system integration
- [ ] Don't forget testing - test components with design system

### Documentation Pitfalls
- [ ] Don't skip usage examples - provide clear implementation guidance
- [ ] Don't ignore responsive documentation - document breakpoint behavior
- [ ] Don't skip accessibility notes - document compliance features
- [ ] Don't forget design system notes - explain integration approach

## Next Steps

After creating static components:

1. **Enhance Components**: Add responsive states, animations, and interactions
2. **Figma Integration**: Use Figma MCP to add missing components
3. **Component Testing**: Test components with different data and states
4. **Development Handoff**: Prepare components for development integration
5. **Documentation Review**: Ensure all components are properly documented
