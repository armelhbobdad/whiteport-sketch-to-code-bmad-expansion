# Sketching Session

## Purpose

To initiate a collaborative sketching session that bridges hand-drawn design thinking with systematic component identification and design system integration. This process enables designers to explore ideas through sketching while maintaining WPS2C compliance and building toward working prototypes.

## WPS2C Method Vision

**Providing a thinking partner to every designer on the planet** - enabling designers everywhere to give more of what is valuable to the world. With deep understanding of users, technology, and what drives people, we provide functionality, beauty, simplicity, and make software endlessly successful by giving people both what they want and what they need.

This sketching session process is a core component of that vision - helping designers explore ideas freely while systematically building toward implementable solutions through collaborative design thinking.

## Core Philosophy

- **Collaborative Design Thinking** - Partner with designers to explore ideas through sketching
- **Systematic Component Discovery** - Identify reusable components from sketches
- **Design System Integration** - Map sketches to existing component library and design tokens
- **Progressive Fidelity** - Start with low-fidelity sketches, evolve to high-fidelity specifications
- **User-Centered Exploration** - Focus on user needs and business goals throughout sketching
- **Iterative Refinement** - Continuously improve sketches based on feedback and insights
- **Implementation Ready** - Every sketch session produces actionable specifications

### Process

#### Step 1.1: Context Review
**Review:**
1. Current scenario documentation and user goals
2. Business objectives and success criteria

5. Technical constraints and opportunities

#### Step 1.2: Session Focus Definition
**Define:**
- **Target Scenario**: [Specific scenario step to sketch]
- **User Persona**: [Primary user group for this session]
- **Business Goal**: [Key business objective this sketch supports]
- **Design Challenge**: [Specific problem to solve through sketching]
- **Success Criteria**: [What makes this sketch session successful]

#### Step 1.3: Sketching Environment Setup
**Prepare:**
- Create or verify Sketches folder structure
- Set up sketching session documentation template
- Identify relevant design system components
- Prepare component library reference materials

### Output

## Phase 2: Collaborative Sketching

### Purpose
Engage in collaborative design thinking through hand-drawn sketching to explore ideas and solutions.

### Process

#### Step 2.1: Sketching Workflow Determination
**Determine:**
- **No Sketch Scenario**: Designer needs to create sketches from scratch
- **Existing Sketch Scenario**: Designer has sketches ready for analysis

### **Workflow A: No Sketch - Collaborative Design Thinking**

#### Step 2.2A: Context Integration
**Integrate:**
1. **Trigger Map Psychology**: Apply user personas and driving forces
2. **Customer Awareness Cycle**: Guide user through awareness → consideration → decision
3. **Golden Rule Application**: Ensure every element propels user toward scenario goal
4. **Previous Scenario Steps**: Build upon established user journey context

#### Step 2.3A: Solution Development
**Facilitate:**
1. "Let's work through this step by step, starting from the user's perspective"
2. "What does the user see when they first arrive at this step?"
3. "What are they thinking and feeling at this moment?"
4. "What actions do they need to take to move forward?"

**Suggest Elements:**
- **Presentation Sections**: Hero, features, testimonials, FAQ
- **Content Strategy**: Headlines, copy, emotional triggers
- **Interactive Parts**: Buttons, forms, navigation elements
- **Features**: Core functionality that serves user needs
- **Forms**: Data collection that advances user journey

#### Step 2.4A: Energy Capture
**Encourage:**
- "Now that we have clarity, let's capture this energy in sketches"
- "Start sketching immediately while the solution is fresh"
- "Don't worry about perfection - we'll refine as we go"
- "Focus on the key elements we just identified"

### **Workflow B: Existing Sketch - Analysis and Specification**

#### Step 2.2B: Sketch Upload and Analysis
**Request:**
- "Please upload your sketch to the Sketches folder in this scenario step"
- "Make the sketch available in the chat so I can analyze it"
- "I'll need to see the image to provide detailed analysis"

#### Step 2.3B: Sketch Analysis
**Analyze:**
1. **Visual Elements**: Identify all interface components and sections
2. **Layout Structure**: Understand the overall page organization
3. **User Flow**: Trace the user's path through the interface
4. **Interactive Elements**: Identify buttons, forms, and interactive components

#### Step 2.4B: Collaborative Clarification
**Ask:**
- "I can see [specific elements] in your sketch - can you explain this section?"
- "What happens when the user interacts with [specific element]?"
- "How does this connect to the user's goal in this scenario?"
- "Are there any parts that aren't clear from the sketch alone?"

#### Step 2.5B: Component Specification
**Specify:**
- Create and link components in the design system
- Document each interface section with proper hierarchy
- Add all necessary copy and translations
- Adjust existing specifications to match the sketch
- Use headlines to mark hierarchy and avoid parentheses

### Output
- **Workflow A**: Hand-drawn sketches with clear design direction
- **Workflow B**: Detailed specifications with component links and translations
- User experience insights and design system integration

## Phase 3: Component Identification

### Purpose
Analyze sketches to identify reusable components and design patterns.

### Process

#### Step 3.1: Component Analysis
**Analyze:**
1. "What atomic components do you see in these sketches?"
2. "What molecular components could we create from these elements?"
3. "What organism-level components are needed for this scenario?"
4. "How do these components relate to our existing design system?"

#### Step 3.2: Component Mapping
**Map:**
- Atomic components (buttons, inputs, icons, etc.)
- Molecular components (forms, cards, navigation, etc.)
- Organism components (headers, sections, layouts, etc.)
- Existing vs. new component requirements

#### Step 3.3: Component Prioritization
**Prioritize:**
- Most critical components for this scenario
- Components that can be reused across scenarios
- Components that need design system integration
- Components requiring new specifications

### Output
- Identified atomic/molecular/organism components
- Component mapping to existing design system
- Prioritized component development plan

### Process

#### Step 4.1: Design System Review
**Review:**
- Current design system structure and components
- Available design tokens and styling
- Component library integration opportunities
- Brand guidelines and visual standards

#### Step 4.2: Component Integration Planning
**Plan:**
- How new components fit into existing atomic/molecular/organism structure
- Design token usage and customization needs
- Component library mapping and variants
- Responsive design considerations

#### Step 4.3: Design System Enhancement
**Identify:**
- Missing design tokens or components
- Opportunities to enhance existing components
- New component specifications needed
- Design system consistency improvements

### Output
