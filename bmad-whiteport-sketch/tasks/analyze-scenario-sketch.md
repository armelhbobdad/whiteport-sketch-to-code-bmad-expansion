# Scenario Step Sketch Analysis and Documentation

## Purpose

To analyze uploaded sketches, ask clarifying questions, and create component specifications with proper hierarchy and translations through collaborative thinking partnership and guided exploration.

## WPS2C Method Vision

**Providing a thinking partner to every designer on the planet** - enabling designers everywhere to give more of what is valuable to the world. With deep understanding of users, technology, and what drives people, we provide functionality, beauty, simplicity, and make software endlessly successful by giving people both what they want and what they need.

This sketch analysis process is a core component of that vision - helping designers transform their creative work into implementable solutions through collaborative analysis and specification.
