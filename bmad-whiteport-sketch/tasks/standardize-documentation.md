# Standardize Documentation

## Overview
Transform existing documentation to meet professional enterprise standards through systematic application of Title-Case-With-Dashes naming, URL-safe file organization, and stakeholder-friendly structure. Based on real-world project experience and PM feedback.

## Primary Goals

### 1. Professional Naming Convention
Apply **Title-Case-With-Dashes** to ALL folders and files for:
- **URL-safe compatibility**: Works seamlessly with web servers, browsers, CDNs
- **Cross-platform consistency**: Functions identically across Windows, Mac, Linux
- **Tool compatibility**: Works with IDEs, command-line tools, file browsers
- **Professional appearance**: Meets enterprise documentation standards

### 2. Enterprise File Organization  
Implement **Sketches/** subfolder structure for:
- **Stakeholder clarity**: Main documentation files immediately visible to PMs
- **Scalable architecture**: Ready for Visual-Design/, Code-Snippets/ expansion
- **Visual asset management**: Clean separation of documentation and supporting files
- **Professional presentation**: Eliminates visual clutter in folder navigation

### 3. Systematic Link Management
Ensure **comprehensive cross-reference integrity** through:
- **Complete path updates**: Update ALL links when renaming files/folders
- **Navigation flow maintenance**: Preserve scenario chains and component references
- **Relative path optimization**: Use appropriate relative paths for efficiency
- **Quality assurance verification**: Test all links after organizational changes

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning
```markdown
1. **Inventory Current Structure**
   - Catalog all folders with spaces or special characters
   - Identify files with inconsistent naming
   - Map all cross-references and link dependencies
   - Document current navigation flows

2. **Plan Naming Transformations**
   - Convert spaces to dashes: "Welcome page" → "Welcome-Page"
   - Apply title case: "welcome-page" → "Welcome-Page"  
   - Ensure URL safety: Remove periods, special characters
   - Maintain logical hierarchies: Pages vs Dialogs distinction

3. **Design Folder Organization**
   - Create Sketches/ subfolders in all page/component directories
   - Plan Visual-Design/ and Code-Snippets/ for future expansion
   - Ensure main .md files remain prominently visible
   - Optimize for PM and stakeholder navigation
```

### Phase 2: Systematic Transformation
```markdown
1. **Rename Folders (Deepest Level First)**
   - Start with page folders: 1.1-Welcome-Page → 1.1-Welcome-Page (already correct)
   - Progress to scenario folders: 01-user-registration → 01-User-Registration
   - Finish with section folders: c-scenarios → C-Scenarios
   - Handle component hierarchy: molecular → Molecular

2. **Rename Files**
   - Apply Title-Case-With-Dashes to all .md files
   - Update image file organization into Sketches/ subfolders
   - Ensure file names match folder naming conventions
   - Maintain descriptive, professional naming

3. **Organize Visual Assets**
   - Create Sketches/ subfolders in each page/component folder
   - Move all .jpg, .png, .svg files into appropriate Sketches/ folders
   - Update all image references to use new paths
   - Verify all images load correctly after reorganization
```

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Link Updates
```markdown
1. **Update Cross-References**
   - Search and replace ALL old folder/file references
   - Update navigation links between pages (Previous/Next)
   - Fix component references throughout documentation
   - Update main README and overview files

2. **Verify Navigation Flows**
   - Test complete scenario chains from start to finish
   - Verify component usage examples still work
   - Check cross-scenario references and links
   - Ensure trigger map and persona links function

3. **Quality Assurance Review**
   - Search for any remaining broken links
   - Verify all images display correctly
   - Test paths in different environments (web, IDE, command-line)
   - Confirm professional appearance for stakeholders
```

## Quality Standards

### Naming Convention Requirements
```markdown
✅ CORRECT Examples:
- Folders: 01-User-Registration/, 1.1-Welcome-Page/, D-Components/
- Files: 1.1-Welcome-Page.md, Product-Card.md, 00-Trigger-Map.md
- Paths: docs/C-Scenarios/01-User-Registration/1.1-Welcome-Page/

❌ INCORRECT Examples:  
- Folders: 01. User registration/, 1.1 Welcome page/, D. Components/
- Files: 1.1-welcome-page.md, product-card.md, 00-trigger-map.md
- Paths: docs/C. Scenarios/01. User registration/1.1 Welcome page/
```

### File Organization Standards
```markdown
✅ PROFESSIONAL Structure:
Product-Card/
├── Product-Card.md            ← Immediately visible to PMs
├── Sketches/                  ← Visual assets organized
│   ├── Product-Card-Concept.jpg
│   └── Product-Card-States.jpg
├── Visual-Design/             ← Future: UI mockups
└── Code-Snippets/             ← Future: Implementation examples

❌ PROBLEMATIC Structure:
product-card/
├── card-concept.jpg           ← Visual clutter
├── card-states.jpg            ← Obscures main file
├── product-card.md            ← Hard to find
└── other-assets.png           ← Disorganized
```

### Link Management Standards
```markdown
✅ SYSTEMATIC Approach:
1. Use comprehensive search-and-replace for path updates
2. Update ALL cross-references, not just obvious ones
3. Test navigation flows after each major change
4. Verify image paths load correctly in all environments
5. Maintain relative path efficiency where appropriate

❌ INCOMPLETE Approach:
1. Update only obvious links, miss edge cases
2. Forget to update image references  
3. Break navigation flows between pages
4. Leave orphaned references in overview files
5. Create inconsistent path structures
```

## Real-World Validation

### Stakeholder Testing
```markdown
1. **PM Perspective Test**
   - Can project managers immediately find main documentation?
   - Are visual assets organized without creating clutter?
   - Does folder structure support efficient project navigation?

2. **Developer Handoff Test**
   - Do all paths work in development environments?
   - Are image references functional across platforms?
   - Does structure scale for additional asset types?

3. **Web Deployment Test**
   - Do all URLs work without encoding issues?
   - Are paths case-insensitive where needed?
   - Does structure support CDN and web server deployment?
```

### Success Criteria
```markdown
✅ **Professional Standards Met When:**
- All folders and files use Title-Case-With-Dashes consistently
- Main documentation files immediately visible to stakeholders
- All cross-references and navigation links function perfectly
- Structure scales efficiently for project growth
- Documentation meets enterprise presentation standards
- File organization optimizes PM and developer productivity
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Avoid These Mistakes
```markdown
❌ **Incomplete Transformation**
- Problem: Renaming some files but not updating all references
- Solution: Use systematic search-and-replace across entire project

❌ **Inconsistent Application**  
- Problem: Some folders follow new convention, others don't
- Solution: Apply Title-Case-With-Dashes universally, no exceptions

❌ **Broken Navigation Flows**
- Problem: Scenario chains break after folder renaming
- Solution: Update Previous/Next links systematically

❌ **Image Path Errors**
- Problem: Images don't load after moving to Sketches/ folders
- Solution: Update ALL image references, test thoroughly

❌ **Tool Compatibility Issues**
- Problem: Paths work in one environment but not others
- Solution: Test across multiple platforms and tools
```

### Recovery Strategies
```markdown
If Issues Arise:
1. **Link Validation**: Use comprehensive grep searches to find broken references
2. **Path Testing**: Test all links in multiple environments systematically  
3. **Incremental Fixes**: Address issues category by category rather than all at once
4. **Documentation**: Keep detailed log of changes for rollback if needed
5. **Stakeholder Communication**: Keep PMs informed of any temporary navigation issues
```
