# build-component-library

## Purpose

To systematically identify, organize, and maintain a comprehensive component library from the sketched user journey. This task ensures that all reusable elements are properly catalogued, documented, and managed as a central design system that supports both design consistency and development efficiency.

## Process

The UX Expert works systematically through all sketches to identify patterns, create component specifications, and maintain the central component library as the single source of truth for reusable UI elements.

### 1. Component Discovery and Analysis

#### **Systematic Sketch Review**
- Review all completed sketches in user journey order
- Identify visual and functional patterns across different pages
- Apply the "Component Rule": elements appearing twice become components
- Document potential components even if not yet repeated

#### **Pattern Recognition**
- **Visual Patterns**: Similar layouts, styling, and visual treatments
- **Functional Patterns**: Elements that serve similar purposes across contexts
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Interactive elements with consistent behavior
- **Content Patterns**: Similar information architecture and content structures

#### **Component Classification**
Organize discovered components by type and complexity:
- **Atomic Components**: Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, icons)
- **Molecular Components**: Combinations of atoms (search bars, form groups)
- **Organism Components**: Complex combinations (navigation headers, card layouts)
- **Template Components**: Page-level layout patterns

### 2. Component Inventory and Prioritization

#### **Comprehensive Component List**
Create a master inventory of all identified components:
- **Component Name**: Descriptive, consistent naming
- **Component Type**: Atomic, molecular, organism classification
- **Usage Frequency**: How often component appears across sketches
- **Pages Used**: Specific pages where component appears
- **Priority Level**: Critical, important, or nice-to-have classification

#### **Priority Assessment Criteria**
- **Usage Frequency**: Components used most often get highest priority
- **Business Critical**: Components supporting key user scenarios
- **Development Impact**: Components that significantly affect development efficiency
- **Design Consistency**: Components that ensure visual and functional consistency

### 3. Component Specification Creation

#### **Systematic Documentation Approach**
For each identified component, create comprehensive specifications:
- Use the create-component-specification task for detailed documentation
- Ensure all states, variants, and behaviors are captured
- Document technical requirements and implementation guidance
- Include usage examples and best practices

#### **Specification Quality Standards**
- **Completeness**: All necessary information for implementation
- **Clarity**: Unambiguous descriptions for development teams
- **Consistency**: Aligned with project terminology and standards
- **Traceability**: Clear connections to sketches and user scenarios

### 4. Library Organization and Structure

#### **File and Folder Organization**
Organize component library for easy navigation and maintenance:
```
Docs/D-Components/

**WHITEPORT METHOD OVERRIDE**: Use alphabetized folder structure with scenarios (Docs/C-Scenarios/01-User-Registration/1.1-Welcome-Page/, Docs/D-Components/) instead of default BMad organization.
├── atomic/
│   ├── buttons/
│   │   ├── primary-button.md
│   │   ├── secondary-button.md
│   │   └── icon-button.md
│   ├── inputs/
│   │   ├── text-input.md
│   │   ├── dropdown.md
│   │   └── checkbox.md
│   └── icons/
├── molecular/
│   ├── forms/
│   ├── navigation/
│   └── cards/
└── organism/
    ├── headers/
    ├── footers/
    └── layouts/
```

#### **Naming Conventions**
- **Consistent Naming**: Use descriptive, standardized names
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Group related components together
- **Version Control**: Include version information in documentation
- **Cross-References**: Maintain links between related components

### 5. Component Relationship Mapping

#### **Dependency Documentation**
- **Component Dependencies**: Which components require others
- **Composition Patterns**: How atomic components combine into molecules
- **Variant Relationships**: How component variants relate to each other
- **Usage Hierarchies**: Primary, secondary, and tertiary usage patterns

#### **Integration Mapping**
- **Page Integration**: How components work together on pages
- **Platform Variations**: Differences across web, mobile, admin platforms
- **User Journey Integration**: How components support user scenarios
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Ensuring unified experience

### 6. Library Maintenance and Evolution

#### **Version Control System**
- **Change Tracking**: Document all modifications and rationale
- **Impact Assessment**: Understand how changes affect existing usage
- **Migration Planning**: Guide for updating existing implementations
- **Deprecation Management**: Handle component retirement gracefully

#### **Quality Assurance Process**
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodic assessment of component library health
- **Usage Validation**: Ensure components meet actual project needs
- **Consistency Checks**: Maintain alignment with design standards
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify and address efficiency issues

### 7. Development Integration

#### **Handoff Documentation**
- **Implementation Priorities**: Order for development team focus
- **Technical Specifications**: Detailed requirements for each component
- **Testing Criteria**: Quality assurance requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Integration Guidelines**: How components work with backend systems

#### **Development Support**
- **Code Examples**: Sample implementations for common patterns
- **API Requirements**: Backend services needed for component functionality
- **Performance Guidelines**: Optimization requirements and constraints
- **Accessibility Standards**: Compliance requirements and testing criteria

### 8. Component Library Validation

#### **Design Consistency Review**
- [ ] All components follow established visual standards
- [ ] Naming conventions are consistent across library
- [ ] Component relationships are clearly documented
- [ ] Usage guidelines are comprehensive and clear

#### **Technical Feasibility Assessment**
- [ ] All components can be technically implemented
- [ ] Performance requirements are realistic and achievable
- [ ] Platform constraints are properly considered
- [ ] Integration requirements are clearly specified

#### **User Experience Validation**
- [ ] Components support identified user scenarios
- [ ] Interaction patterns are consistent and intuitive
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are comprehensive
- [ ] Component library serves persona usage goals

### 9. Documentation and Communication

#### **Library Documentation**
- **Overview Document**: Introduction to component library structure
- **Usage Guidelines**: Best practices for component selection and implementation
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Process for adding or modifying components
- **Style Guide**: Visual and functional standards for component design

#### **Team Communication**
- **Component Catalog**: Visual overview of all available components
- **Implementation Status**: Tracking of development progress
- **Change Notifications**: Communication about component updates
- **Training Materials**: Resources for team members using the library
