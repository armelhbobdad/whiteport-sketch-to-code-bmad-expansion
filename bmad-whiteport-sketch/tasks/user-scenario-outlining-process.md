# User Scenario Outlining Process

## Purpose

To create a systematic, value-driven approach for outlining user scenarios that facilitates a marriage between user goals and business objectives. This process enables both UX and PM agents to understand the why behind every action, identify clandestine and sometimes conflicting objectives, and progress to a higher plane where everyone involved benefits. The approach is grounded in Susan Dray's philosophy of empowering users through contextual understanding and user-centered design from the top down.

## WPS2C Method Vision

**Providing a thinking partner to every designer on the planet** - enabling designers everywhere to give more of what is valuable to the world. With deep understanding of users, technology, and what drives people, we provide functionality, beauty, simplicity, and make software endlessly successful by giving people both what they want and what they need.

This scenario outlining process is a core component of that vision - helping designers understand not just what users say they want, but what they truly need to grow, succeed, and find fulfillment in their interactions with technology.

## Core Philosophy

- **Marriage of Goals** - Facilitate a marriage between user goals and business objectives
- **Understanding the Why** - There is a why behind every action; understand both business needs and users' clandestine, sometimes conflicting objectives
- **Higher Plane Design** - Progress to a higher plane where everyone involved benefits
- **Empowering Users** - Design systems that help users grow and become more capable, not just make things effortless
- **Contextual Understanding** - Deeply understand users in their natural environments and real-world contexts
- **User-Centered from Top Down** - User-centered design as core strategy, not just a team task
- **Natural Flow** - Scenarios start from real user contexts, not artificial entry points
- **Sequential Dependencies** - Identify which user groups need to act first
- **Iterative Refinement** - Trigger map evolves based on designer intentions and validation

## Phase 2: Deep Understanding of User-Business Marriage

### Purpose
Understand the deeper motivations, clandestine objectives, and contextual realities that drive both user actions and business needs.

### Process

#### Step 2.1: User Motivation Deep Dive
**Questions to Explore:**
1. "What are the user's stated goals versus their unstated, clandestine objectives?"
2. "What contextual factors in their natural environment influence their behavior?"
3. "How do their cultural, social, and personal contexts shape their needs?"
4. "What would empower this user to grow and become more capable?"

#### Step 2.2: Business Objective Deep Dive
**Questions to Explore:**
1. "What are the business's stated goals versus their unstated, strategic objectives?"
2. "What contextual factors in the market and industry influence business needs?"
3. "How do business constraints and opportunities shape their requirements?"
4. "What would enable the business to grow and become more capable?"

#### Step 2.3: Conflict and Alignment Analysis
**Questions to Explore:**
1. "Where do user and business objectives naturally align?"
2. "Where do they conflict or create tension?"
3. "What are the clandestine objectives that might not be immediately obvious?"
4. "How can we design for the higher plane where both benefit?"

#### Step 2.4: Contextual Understanding
**Questions to Explore:**
1. "How do users actually live and work in their natural environments?"
2. "What are the real-world constraints and opportunities they face?"
3. "How does the business operate in its actual market context?"
4. "What ethnographic insights can inform our design approach?"

### Output
- Deep understanding of user motivations and clandestine objectives
- Clear picture of business needs and strategic objectives
- Identification of alignment opportunities and conflict areas
- Contextual insights for empowering design solutions

## Phase 1: Trigger Map Pressure Test

### Purpose
Validate and refine the trigger map to ensure we're focusing on the most critical elements for scenario creation.

### Process

#### Step 1.1: Business Goal Pressure Test
**Show Trigger Map Priorities:**
1. Present the MOST prioritized business goal from the trigger map
2. Show the business goal hierarchy and ranking
3. Display the critical success factors for each goal
4. "Are you satisfied with this as our primary business focus?"

**Action if Unsatisfied:**
- Go back to trigger map and revise business goals
- Re-prioritize based on designer intentions
- Update trigger map documentation

#### Step 1.2: User Priority Pressure Test
**Show Trigger Map Priorities:**
1. Present the MOST prioritized user from the trigger map
2. Show the user hierarchy and ranking
3. Display the critical success factors for each user group
4. "Does this user group align with your design intentions?"

**Action if Unsatisfied:**
- Revise user personas in trigger map
- Adjust user prioritization based on designer insights
- Update trigger map documentation

#### Step 1.3: Usage Goal Pressure Test
**Show Trigger Map Priorities:**
1. Present the MOST important positive usage goal from the trigger map
2. Present the MOST important negative usage goal to avoid from the trigger map
3. Show the usage goal hierarchy and ranking
4. "Do these usage goals match your vision for the product?"

**Action if Unsatisfied:**
- Refine usage goals in trigger map
- Align with designer's product vision
- Update trigger map documentation

### Output
- Validated and refined trigger map
- Clear focus on most critical business goal, user, and usage goals
- Designer alignment on priorities

## Phase 2: Scenario Identification

### Purpose
Identify the most valuable user actions that directly support business goals.

### Process

#### Step 2.1: Value-Driven Action Identification
**Questions to Ask:**
1. "What is the most valuable action a user can take that directly supports our prioritized business goal?"
2. "What would be the fastest, most streamlined process for a user to complete this action?"
3. "Which prioritized user group would take this action?"
4. "What's the natural starting point for this user? (start page, search, social media, referral, etc.)"
5. "What does success look like for both the user and the business?"

#### Step 2.2: Scenario Scope Definition
**Define:**
- **Target User**: [Most prioritized user from pressure test]
- **Business Goal**: [Most prioritized business goal from pressure test]
- **Positive Usage Goal**: [Most important positive usage goal]
- **Negative Usage Goal**: [Most important negative usage goal to avoid]
- **Natural Starting Point**: [Real user context, not artificial entry]
- **Success Outcome**: [Clear value for both user and business]

### Output
- Clear scenario scope and focus
- Identified most valuable user action
- Defined success criteria

## Phase 3: Dependency Mapping

### Purpose
Identify user group sequences and dependencies that must be considered.

### Process

#### Step 3.1: User Group Sequence Analysis
**Questions to Ask:**
1. "Do we have different target groups that need to act in sequence?"
2. "Which user group must act first for others to succeed?"
3. "What's the critical path from first user action to business value creation?"
4. "Are there any circular dependencies or deadlocks?"

#### Step 3.2: Dependency Documentation
**Document:**
- User group action sequence
- Critical path to business value
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Potential bottlenecks or blockers

### Output
- Clear user group action sequence
- Identified dependencies and prerequisites
- Critical path to business value creation

---

## Phase 4: Scenario Documentation

### Purpose
Create structured documentation for the identified scenario.

### Process

#### Step 4.1: Create Scenario Overview
**Create:** `Docs/C-Scenarios/00-scenarios.md`
- List all identified scenarios
- Document scenario priorities
- Include dependency relationships

#### Step 4.2: Create First Scenario Structure
**Create:**
- `01-[Most-Important-Scenario-Name]/` - Scenario folder
- `1.1-[Starting-Step-Name]/` - First step folder
- `1.1-[Starting-Step-Name]/Sketches/` - Sketches subfolder
- `1.1-[Starting-Step-Name]/1.1-[Starting-Step-Name].md` - Step documentation

#### Step 4.3: Document First Step
**Include:**
- Scenario step overview
- User context and motivation
- Journey step details (user sees/thinks/does/system responds/value created)
- Success outcome
- Next steps needed

### Output
- Structured scenario documentation
- Ready-to-sketch first step
- Clear next steps for designer

1. "Does this scenario align with your design vision?"
2. "Are you satisfied with the user group prioritization?"
3. "Does the business goal focus match your intentions?"
4. "What would you change about this scenario scope?"

#### Step 5.2: Trigger Map Refinement
**If Changes Needed:**
- Revise trigger map based on designer feedback
- Update business goals, user priorities, or usage goals
- Re-run pressure test with refined trigger map
- Update scenario scope accordingly

#### Step 5.3: Scenario Iteration
**Process:**
