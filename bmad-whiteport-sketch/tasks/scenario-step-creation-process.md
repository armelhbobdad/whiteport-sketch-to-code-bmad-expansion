# Scenario Step Creation Process

## Purpose

To create a systematic, value-driven approach for creating individual scenario steps that maintain the marriage between user goals and business objectives throughout each step of the user journey. This process enables both UX and PM agents to understand the deeper motivations behind each user action, document the complete user experience, and ensure every step delivers value for both user and business.

## WPS2C Method Vision

**Providing a thinking partner to every designer on the planet** - enabling designers everywhere to give more of what is valuable to the world. With deep understanding of users, technology, and what drives people, we provide functionality, beauty, simplicity, and make software endlessly successful by giving people both what they want and what they need.

This scenario step creation process is a core component of that vision - helping designers understand not just what users do at each step, but why they do it, what they're thinking, and how each action contributes to their growth and success.

## Core Philosophy

- **Marriage of Goals** - Each step must serve both user goals and business objectives
- **Understanding the Why** - Document not just what users do, but why they do it and what they're thinking
- **Higher Plane Design** - Each step should progress users toward greater capability and fulfillment
- **Empowering Users** - Steps should help users grow and become more capable, not just complete tasks
- **Contextual Understanding** - Consider the user's mental state, environment, and constraints at each step
- **Natural Flow** - Steps should feel like natural progressions, not artificial checkpoints
- **Value Creation** - Each step must create clear value for both user and business
- **Iterative Refinement** - Steps evolve based on designer feedback and user insights

**Questions to Explore:**
1. "What business value is created when the user completes this step?"
2. "How does this step contribute to the overall business goal?"
3. "What business constraints or opportunities influence this step?"
4. "What data or insights does the business gain from this step?"

#### Step 1.3: Step Purpose Definition
**Questions to Explore:**
1. "What is the primary purpose of this step for the user?"
2. "What is the primary purpose of this step for the business?"
3. "How do these purposes align or conflict?"
4. "What would success look like for both user and business?"

### Output
- Clear understanding of user context and mental state
- Clear understanding of business value creation
- Defined step purpose and success criteria
- Identified alignment opportunities and potential conflicts

## Phase 2: User Mental Model Deep Dive

### Purpose
Understand the user's thoughts, feelings, and decision-making process at this step.

### Process

#### Step 2.1: User Sees Analysis
**Questions to Explore:**
1. "What does the user see when they reach this step?"
2. "What visual elements are most important to them?"
3. "What information do they need to make decisions?"
4. "What might be confusing or unclear to them?"

#### Step 2.2: User Thinks Analysis
**Questions to Explore:**
1. "What is the user thinking when they see this step?"
2. "What questions are going through their mind?"
3. "What concerns or hesitations might they have?"
4. "What would make them feel confident and empowered?"

#### Step 2.3: User Does Analysis
**Questions to Explore:**
1. "What specific action does the user take at this step?"
2. "What are the different ways they might complete this step?"
3. "What would make this action feel natural and effortless?"
4. "What would make this action feel empowering and growth-oriented?"

#### Step 2.4: System Response Analysis
**Questions to Explore:**
1. "How does the system respond to the user's action?"
2. "What feedback does the user receive?"
3. "How does the system acknowledge the user's effort?"
4. "What would make the user feel successful and capable?"

### Output
- Detailed understanding of user's visual experience
- Clear picture of user's mental process and decision-making
- Defined user actions and system responses
- Identified opportunities for empowerment and growth

## Phase 3: Step Documentation Creation

### Purpose
Create comprehensive documentation for the scenario step that captures all insights and provides clear direction for implementation.

### Process

#### Step 3.1: Create Step Structure
**Create:**
- `[Step-Number]-[Step-Name]/` - Step folder
- `[Step-Number]-[Step-Name]/Sketches/` - Sketches subfolder
- `[Step-Number]-[Step-Name]/[Step-Number]-[Step-Name].md` - Step documentation

#### Step 3.2: Document Step Overview
**Include:**
- Step purpose and context
- User mental state and motivations
- Business value creation
- Success criteria for both user and business

#### Step 3.3: Document User Journey Details
**Include:**
- **User sees**: What the user sees when they reach this step
- **User thinks**: What the user is thinking and feeling
- **User does**: The specific action the user takes
- **System responds**: How the system acknowledges and responds
- **Value created**: Value for user | Value for business

#### Step 3.4: Document Implementation Requirements
**Include:**
- Visual design requirements
- Interaction requirements
- Content requirements
- Technical requirements
- Accessibility requirements

### Output
- Structured step documentation
- Clear implementation requirements
- Ready-to-sketch step with all context
- Clear next steps for designer and developer

## Phase 4: Value Flow Validation

### Purpose
Ensure each step creates clear value for both user and business, and contributes to the overall scenario success.

### Process

#### Step 4.1: User Value Validation
**Questions to Ask:**
1. "Does this step help the user achieve their goal?"
2. "Does this step make the user feel more capable?"
3. "Does this step reduce friction or confusion?"

3. "Does this step provide useful data or insights?"
4. "Does this step build user engagement or loyalty?"

#### Step 4.3: Flow Validation
**Questions to Ask:**
