# Enforce Design System First

## Task Overview
This task helps ensure the design system is always updated with all necessary components before any code generation or prototype creation. This systematic approach maintains consistency and prevents incomplete implementations.

## Task Purpose
- **Single Source of Truth**: Maintain design system as the authoritative component reference
- **Prevent Ad-hoc Development**: Stop creation of components outside the design system
- **Ensure Systematic Approach**: Enforce proper component documentation workflow
- **Maintain Quality**: Guarantee all components meet design system standards

## Core Principle
**Please ensure complete design system integration before code generation to maintain consistency and prevent incomplete implementations.**

## When to Use
- **BEFORE** any prototype creation from sketches
- **BEFORE** generating frontend code
- **BEFORE** creating React components
- **WHEN** user requests code generation
- **WHEN** new components are identified in sketches

## Enforcement Rules

### Rule 1: Design System Validation
- **Please ensure**: All sketch components exist in design system to maintain consistency
- **Please ensure**: All components have complete specifications for team reference
- **Please ensure**: All components are integrated into Design System Guide for accessibility
- **Please ensure**: Complete validation before code generation to prevent incomplete implementations

### Rule 2: Component Documentation
- **Please ensure**: Every component has proper documentation for consistency
- **Please ensure**: All components follow atomic design structure for organization
- **Please ensure**: All components use foundation design tokens for visual consistency
- **Please ensure**: All components include usage guidelines for team reference

### Rule 3: Design System Integration
- **Please ensure**: All components are added to Design System Guide for team reference
- **Please ensure**: All components are properly categorized for organization
- **Please ensure**: All components are accessible via navigation for easy discovery
- **Please ensure**: All components are tested in showcase for quality assurance

### Rule 4: Quality Assurance
- **Please ensure**: All components meet accessibility standards for inclusive design
- **Please ensure**: All components follow naming conventions for consistency
- **Please ensure**: All components are consistent with design system for visual coherence
- **Please ensure**: All components are properly linked and referenced for maintainability

## Task Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Code Validation
- **Analyze Request**: Identify what code generation is requested
- **Check Sketch Components**: Verify all sketch elements are identified
- **Validate Design System**: Ensure all components exist in design system
- **Check Integration**: Verify components are properly integrated

### Step 2: Design System Updates
- **Create Missing Components**: Document any missing components
- **Update Specifications**: Ensure all components have complete specs
- **Integrate Components**: Add components to Design System Guide
- **Test Integration**: Verify components work in showcase

### Step 3: Final Validation
- **Complete Coverage**: Verify 100% component coverage
- **Quality Check**: Ensure all components meet standards
- **Integration Test**: Verify design system integration
- **Ready Confirmation**: Confirm design system is complete

### Step 4: Code Generation Approval
- **Validation Complete**: All components are in design system
- **Integration Complete**: All components are properly integrated
- **Quality Assured**: All components meet standards
- **Approved for Code**: Design system is ready for code generation

## Enforcement Actions

### If Components Missing
- **STOP**: Halt all code generation
- **CREATE**: Create missing components in design system
- **DOCUMENT**: Complete component documentation
- **INTEGRATE**: Add components to Design System Guide
- **VALIDATE**: Verify complete integration

### If Specifications Incomplete
- **STOP**: Halt all code generation
- **COMPLETE**: Finish component specifications
- **VERIFY**: Check all required fields are filled
- **TEST**: Verify specifications are complete
- **APPROVE**: Confirm specifications are ready

### If Integration Missing
- **STOP**: Halt all code generation
- **INTEGRATE**: Add components to Design System Guide
- **TEST**: Verify components work in showcase
- **NAVIGATE**: Ensure components are accessible
- **APPROVE**: Confirm integration is complete

## Success Criteria
- **100% Component Coverage**: All sketch elements have design system components
- **Complete Documentation**: All components have proper specifications
- **Full Integration**: All components are in Design System Guide
- **Quality Assured**: All components meet design system standards
- **Ready for Code**: Design system is complete for code generation

## Error Prevention
- **Systematic Validation**: Check every component before proceeding
- **No Shortcuts**: Complete all steps before code generation
- **Quality Focus**: Maintain high standards throughout
- **Consistency Enforcement**: Ensure all components follow patterns

## Output
- **Enforcement Report**: Status of design system completeness
- **Component Status**: List of all components and their state
- **Integration Status**: Status of Design System Guide integration
- **Approval Confirmation**: Confirmation that code generation can proceed

## Dependencies
- **Design System Structure**: Must have proper atomic design structure
- **Component Templates**: Must have component documentation templates
- **Design System Guide**: Must have interactive showcase
- **Validation Tools**: Must have component validation capabilities

## Quality Assurance
- **Zero Tolerance**: No exceptions to design system first rule
- **Complete Validation**: Every component must be validated
- **Systematic Approach**: Follow established workflow
- **Quality Standards**: Maintain high component quality
