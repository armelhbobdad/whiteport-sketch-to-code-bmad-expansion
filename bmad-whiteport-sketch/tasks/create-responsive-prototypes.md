# create-responsive-prototypes

## Purpose

To create working HTML/CSS prototypes that demonstrate component behavior and design across different screen sizes and devices. These prototypes serve as visual validation tools and provide immediate feedback on responsive design decisions.

## Process

The Developer will create functional prototypes that showcase components and layouts across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints, ensuring a consistent and optimal user experience across all devices.

### 1. Prototype Architecture

#### **HTML Structure**
- **Semantic Markup**: Clean, accessible HTML structure
- **Component Integration**: All specified components properly implemented
- **Content Integration**: Real content from scenario specifications
- **Responsive Structure**: Mobile-first HTML that scales up

#### **CSS Implementation**
- **Design System Integration**: Use centralized CSS and design tokens
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Implement mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
- **Component Styling**: All components styled according to specifications
- **Interactive States**: Hover, active, and focus states implemented

### 2. Responsive Design Strategy

#### **Mobile-First Approach**
- **Base Styles**: Mobile-optimized base styles and layout

#### **Interactive Components**
- **Touch Targets**: Appropriate touch target sizes for mobile
- **Hover States**: Desktop hover states that don't interfere with touch
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support across all devices
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling for accessibility

### 4. Content Adaptation

#### **Typography Scaling**
- **Responsive Typography**: Text that scales appropriately
- **Line Height**: Optimal line height for readability
- **Font Sizes**: Appropriate font sizes for each breakpoint
- **Text Hierarchy**: Clear text hierarchy across all devices

#### **Image and Media**
- **Responsive Images**: Images that scale and crop appropriately
- **Aspect Ratios**: Maintain proper aspect ratios
- **Loading Optimization**: Optimized loading for different devices
- **Format Selection**: Appropriate image formats for different screens

### 5. Navigation and Interaction

#### **Mobile Navigation**
- **Hamburger Menus**: Collapsible navigation for mobile
- **Touch Gestures**: Swipe and touch gesture support
- **Bottom Navigation**: Mobile-optimized navigation patterns
- **Overlay Menus**: Full-screen overlay navigation

#### **Desktop Navigation**
- **Horizontal Menus**: Traditional horizontal navigation
- **Dropdown Menus**: Hover-activated dropdown menus
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Persistent sidebar navigation
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Clear navigation hierarchy

### 6. Performance Optimization

#### **Mobile Performance**
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized for mobile network conditions
- **Image Optimization**: Compressed and optimized images
- **CSS Optimization**: Minified and optimized CSS
- **JavaScript Optimization**: Minimal JavaScript for mobile

#### **Desktop Performance**
- **Enhanced Features**: Additional features for desktop users
- **Smooth Animations**: Hardware-accelerated animations
- **Advanced Interactions**: More complex interaction patterns
- **Rich Content**: Enhanced content and media

### 7. Testing and Validation

#### **Cross-Device Testing**
- **Real Device Testing**: Test on actual devices when possible
- **Browser Testing**: Test across different browsers
- **Screen Size Testing**: Test across different screen sizes
- **Orientation Testing**: Test both portrait and landscape orientations

#### **Accessibility Testing**
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Test with screen readers
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Test keyboard-only navigation
- **Color Contrast**: Test color contrast ratios
- **Focus Indicators**: Test focus indicators and management

### 8. Prototype Features

#### **Interactive Elements**
- **Working Forms**: Functional forms with validation
- **Navigation**: Working navigation between pages
- **Modals**: Functional modal dialogs
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and animations

#### **Content Management**
- **Dynamic Content**: Content that adapts to screen size
- **Language Switching**: Bilingual content support
- **Theme Switching**: Light/dark theme support
- **User Preferences**: Respect user preferences and settings

## Output

Responsive prototypes that include:

- **Multi-Device Support**: Works across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Responsive Layouts**: Layouts that adapt to screen size
- **Interactive Components**: Working interactive elements
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized for all devices
- **Accessibility Features**: Built-in accessibility support
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works in all modern browsers

## Integration with WPS2C Workflow

### **Design Validation**
- Prototypes validate responsive design decisions
- Visual feedback on component behavior across devices
- Stakeholder approval based on working examples
- Design iteration based on prototype testing

### **Development Preparation**
- Working code examples for implementation
- Responsive patterns established and tested
- Performance benchmarks for optimization
- Accessibility patterns for compliance

### **Team Collaboration**
- Visual prototypes enable effective communication
- Cross-device testing with all team members
- Stakeholder validation across different devices
- Developer handoff with responsive implementation guidance

This task ensures that the WPS2C methodology produces responsive prototypes that validate design decisions across all devices while maintaining the collaborative and systematic approach that makes the methodology effective.
