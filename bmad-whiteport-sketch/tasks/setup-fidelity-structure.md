# Setup Fidelity-Based Structure

## Overview
Create comprehensive fidelity-based folder organization for scenario steps or components, supporting complete design progression from conceptual sketches to implementation-ready specifications.

## Purpose
Establish standardized visual asset organization that supports the natural design workflow progression while maintaining professional stakeholder presentation and development team efficiency.

### Fidelity Progression Phases

#### Phase 1: Sketches/
**Purpose**: Rapid ideation and concept validation  
**Fidelity**: Low fidelity, high speed iteration  
**Content Standards**:
- Hand-drawn conceptual sketches
- Device-specific variations: `_Desktop_Concept`, `_Mobile_Concept`, `_Tablet_Concept`
- Annotation of key interactions and functionality
- Quick iteration cycles supported
- Focus on layout, flow, and core functionality

**File Naming Examples**:
- `1.1-Start-Page_Desktop_Concept.jpg`
- `1.1-Start-Page_Mobile_Concept.jpg`
- `1.1-Start-Page_Flow_Sketch.jpg`
- `1.1-Start-Page_Interaction_Notes.jpg`

#### Phase 2: Wireframes/
**Purpose**: Structural design with defined hierarchy  
**Fidelity**: Medium fidelity with functionality focus  
**Content Standards**:
- Precise component placement and sizing
- Clear information hierarchy
- Detailed interaction specifications
- Responsive behavior documentation
- User interaction flow documentation

**File Naming Examples**:
- `1.1-Start-Page_Desktop_Wireframe.png`
- `1.1-Start-Page_Mobile_Wireframe.png`
- `1.1-Start-Page_Interactive_Elements.png`
- `1.1-Start-Page_Responsive_Specs.png`

#### Phase 3: Visual-Design/
**Purpose**: High fidelity mockups with final visual treatment  
**Fidelity**: Pixel-perfect designs ready for development  
**Content Standards**:
- Complete brand application throughout
- Color schemes, typography, and visual hierarchy
- Pixel-perfect execution of approved wireframes
- Complete responsive specifications
- Accessibility considerations documented

**File Naming Examples**:
- `1.1-Start-Page_Desktop_Final.png`
- `1.1-Start-Page_Mobile_Final.png`
- `1.1-Start-Page_Style_Guide.png`
- `1.1-Start-Page_Accessibility_Specs.png`

#### Phase 4: Prototypes/
**Purpose**: Interactive demonstrations and user testing  
**Fidelity**: Functional interactive experiences  
**Content Standards**:
- Functional interactive demonstrations
- Realistic content and data integration
- User testing validation results
- Performance considerations documented
- Animation specifications and micro-interactions

**File Naming Examples**:
- `1.1-Start-Page_Interactive_Demo.mp4`
- `1.1-Start-Page_User_Testing_Results.pdf`
- `1.1-Start-Page_Animation_Specs.json`
- `1.1-Start-Page_Performance_Benchmarks.md`

#### Phase 5: Code-Snippets/
**Purpose**: Implementation support and development handoff  
**Fidelity**: Production-ready implementation guidance  
**Content Standards**:
- Production-ready implementation examples
- Component code snippets and integration guides
- API integration examples and data structures
- Development handoff documentation
- Cross-platform compatibility verification

**File Naming Examples**:
- `1.1-Start-Page_Component.tsx`
- `1.1-Start-Page_Styles.css`
- `1.1-Start-Page_API_Integration.md`
- `1.1-Start-Page_Performance_Optimization.md`

## Implementation Process

### Step 1: Assess Current Structure
```markdown
1. **Inventory Existing Assets**
   - Catalog current visual assets and their fidelity levels
   - Identify which phase each asset belongs to
   - Map current file organization gaps

2. **Plan Fidelity Migration**
   - Determine which phases are needed for current project stage
   - Create migration plan for existing assets
   - Establish quality standards for each phase
```

### Step 2: Create Folder Structure
```markdown
1. **Create Base Directories**
   - Create all five fidelity-based subfolders
   - Ensure consistent naming across all scenario steps
   - Maintain parallel structure for components

2. **Organize Existing Assets**
   - Move existing sketches to appropriate Sketches/ folders
   - Reorganize any existing wireframes or designs
   - Update all file references in documentation
```

### Step 3: Establish Standards
```markdown
1. **Document File Naming Conventions**
   - Apply consistent device and fidelity indicators
   - Ensure URL-safe, cross-platform compatibility
   - Maintain professional appearance standards

2. **Create Quality Guidelines**
   - Define quality standards for each fidelity phase
   - Establish review checkpoints between phases
   - Document handoff requirements between design stages
```

## Quality Assurance Standards

### Folder Organization Quality
```markdown
✅ **Professional Structure Requirements**:
- Main documentation file immediately visible in root of step folder
- All visual assets organized by fidelity level
- Consistent naming conventions applied throughout
- No visual clutter in main folder navigation
- Scalable structure ready for project growth

✅ **Stakeholder Accessibility**:
- Project managers can quickly find main documentation
- Designers can efficiently navigate between fidelity levels
- Developers have clear implementation guidance
- Visual assets don't obscure critical documentation
```

### Phase Progression Quality
```markdown
✅ **Design Workflow Support**:
- Clear progression path from concept to implementation
- Quality gates between fidelity phases
- Consistent standards across all scenario steps
- Efficient iteration cycles within each phase
- Smooth handoff between design stages

✅ **Cross-Phase Consistency**:
