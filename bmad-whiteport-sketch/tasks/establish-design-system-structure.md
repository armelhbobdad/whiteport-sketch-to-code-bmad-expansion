# Establish Design System Structure

**Task**: Automatically create complete design system structure when users start scenario sketching process  
**Agent**: whiteport-pm (coordinates with whiteport-ux-expert)  
**Phase**: Pre-Sketching Setup  
**Priority**: High

## Task Overview

This task ensures that the complete design system structure is automatically established before users begin the scenario sketching process. This prevents the degradation that occurred in previous projects and ensures all components have a proper home from the start.

## Prerequisites

- Project has completed A-Product-Brief and B-Trigger-Map phases
- User is about to start scenario sketching process
- Design system selection has been completed (if applicable)

## Task Steps

### **Step 1: Verify Design System Structure Exists**
1. **Check Current Structure**: Verify if D-Design-System folder exists
2. **Assess Completeness**: Check if complete folder structure is in place
3. **Identify Gaps**: Note any missing folders or components

### **Step 2: Create Complete Folder Structure**
1. **Create Main Folders**: Ensure all atomic/molecular/organism folders exist
2. **Create Subfolders**: Set up all component type subfolders
3. **Create Foundation Files**: Ensure design system documentation exists

### **Step 3: Establish Foundation Tokens**
1. **Foundation Structure**: Create 02-Foundation/ with Colors/, Typography/, Spacing/, Breakpoints/
2. **Design Tokens**: Set up complete design token system with CSS custom properties
3. **Foundation Documentation**: Create comprehensive design system foundation

### **Step 4: Establish Component Organization**
1. **Atomic Components**: Create Buttons/, Headlines/, Texts/, Icons/, Inputs/, Feedback/, Overlay/ folders
2. **Molecular Components**: Create Forms/, Media/, Navigation/, Trust/, Cards/, Lists/, Tables/ folders
3. **Organism Components**: Create Sections/, Layout/, Content/ folders

### **Step 5: Create Foundation Documentation**
1. **Main Design System File**: Create comprehensive design system guide
2. **Interactive Showcase**: Create interactive HTML component showcase
3. **Integration**: Ensure Foundation tokens integrate with atomic components

### **Step 6: Coordinate with UX Expert**
1. **Handoff to UX Expert**: Transfer design system structure to UX expert
2. **Component Discovery**: UX expert will discover components through sketching process
3. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure WPS2C compliance throughout

## Quality Standards

### **WPS2C Compliance**
- **Complete Structure**: All folders created before sketching begins
- **Empty Folders Ready**: Components will be discovered through sketching process
- **No Speculation**: Only create structure, not components
- **Proper Organization**: Follow atomic design principles

### **Prevention of Degradation**
- **Automatic Setup**: Structure created before any sketching work
- **Complete Coverage**: All typical component types represented
- **Scalable Design**: Structure can grow with project needs
- **Consistent Naming**: Follow established naming conventions

## Integration with Workflow

### **Before Sketching Begins**
- **PM Action**: Run this task when user starts scenario sketching
- **Structure Creation**: Ensure complete folder structure exists
- **Handoff to UX**: Transfer to UX expert for component discovery

### **During Sketching Process**
- **Component Discovery**: UX expert discovers components through sketches
- **Structure Utilization**: Components placed in appropriate folders
- **Quality Maintenance**: WPS2C compliance maintained throughout

## Success Criteria

### **Structure Created**
- [ ] Complete D-Design-System folder structure exists
- [ ] All atomic/molecular/organism folders created
- [ ] All component type subfolders created
- [ ] Foundation documentation in place

### **Ready for Sketching**
- [ ] UX expert can begin component discovery
- [ ] All components have proper home folders
- [ ] No degradation risk during sketching process
- [ ] WPS2C methodology supported

### **Quality Assured**
- [ ] WPS2C compliance maintained

## Examples

### **Dog Week Project Example**

**Before Structure Creation**:
```
docs/
├── A-Product-Brief/
├── B-Trigger-Map/
└── C-Scenarios/
    └── 01-Customer-Onboarding/
        └── 1.1-Start-Page/
```

**After Structure Creation**:
```

├── A-Product-Brief/
├── B-Trigger-Map/
├── C-Scenarios/
│   └── 01-Customer-Onboarding/
│       └── 1.1-Start-Page/

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### **Structure Creation Pitfalls**
- [ ] Don't create components - only create empty folder structure
- [ ] Don't skip any folder types - ensure complete coverage
- [ ] Don't use inconsistent naming - follow established conventions
- [ ] Don't create overly complex hierarchies - keep it simple

### **Integration Pitfalls**
- [ ] Don't skip handoff to UX expert - they need to discover components
- [ ] Don't create structure after sketching begins - do it before
- [ ] Don't skip quality assurance - maintain WPS2C compliance
- [ ] Don't forget to update documentation - keep it current

## Next Steps

After establishing design system structure:

1. **Handoff to UX Expert**: Transfer to UX expert for component discovery
2. **Begin Sketching Process**: User can start scenario sketching with confidence
3. **Component Discovery**: Components will be discovered and placed appropriately
4. **Quality Maintenance**: Ensure WPS2C compliance throughout process
