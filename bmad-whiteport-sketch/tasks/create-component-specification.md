# create-component-specification

## Purpose

To create detailed specifications for reusable UI components identified during the sketching process. This task ensures that components appearing multiple times across the user journey are properly documented as a single source of truth, supporting both design consistency and development efficiency.

## Process

The UX Expert works with the designer to create comprehensive component documentation that serves as the master specification for all reusable UI elements.

### 1. Component Identification and Scope

#### **Component Recognition Criteria**
Apply the Whiteport "Component Rule":
- **Primary Trigger**: Element appears for the second time in any sketch
- **Functional Similarity**: Elements that serve the same purpose across different contexts
- **Visual Consistency**: Elements that should maintain consistent appearance
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Interactive elements with similar behavior requirements

#### **Component Boundary Definition**
- **Atomic Level**: Define the smallest reusable unit (button, input field, icon)
- **Molecular Level**: Combinations of atoms (search bar, form section)
- **Organism Level**: Complex components (navigation header, user profile card)
- **Context Consideration**: How component adapts to different usage contexts

### 2. Component Documentation Structure

#### **Component Identity Section**
- **Component Name**: Clear, descriptive name following naming conventions
- **Component Type**: Atomic, molecular, or organism classification
- **Purpose Statement**: One-sentence description of component function
- **Usage Context**: Where and when this component should be used

#### **Visual Specification Section**
- **Default Appearance**: Primary visual state description
- **Dimensions**: Size specifications and responsive behavior
- **Spacing**: Internal padding and external margins
- **Typography**: Font specifications when text is included
- **Color Palette**: All colors used in different states

### 3. State and Variant Documentation

#### **Interactive States**
Document all possible states for interactive components:
- **Default State**: Normal appearance when not being interacted with
- **Hover State**: Appearance when cursor hovers over component
- **Active State**: Appearance when component is being clicked/pressed
- **Focus State**: Appearance when component has keyboard focus
- **Disabled State**: Appearance when component is not available for interaction
- **Loading State**: Appearance during processing or data loading
- **Error State**: Appearance when validation or processing fails

#### **Content Variants**
Document how component adapts to different content:
- **Short Content**: How component handles minimal content
- **Long Content**: Behavior with extensive content or text overflow
- **Empty State**: Appearance when no content is available
- **Rich Content**: Handling of images, videos, or complex content

#### **Contextual Variants**
Document component variations for different contexts:
- **Size Variations**: Small, medium, large versions
- **Style Variations**: Primary, secondary, tertiary styling
- **Platform Variations**: Web, mobile, admin portal differences
- **Theme Variations**: Light, dark, or branded theme adaptations

### 4. Behavioral Specification

#### **Interaction Patterns**
- **Click/Tap Behavior**: What happens when user interacts
- **Keyboard Interactions**: Tab navigation and keyboard shortcuts
- **Touch Gestures**: Mobile-specific interaction patterns
- **Animation Timing**: Transition durations and easing functions

#### **Responsive Behavior**
- **Breakpoint Adaptations**: How component changes at different screen sizes
- **Flexible Sizing**: Rules for component growth and shrinkage
- **Content Reflow**: How internal content reorganizes
- **Touch Target Sizing**: Mobile accessibility requirements

### 5. Content Requirements

#### **Text Content Specifications**
- **Character Limits**: Maximum and recommended text lengths
- **Content Guidelines**: Tone, style, and formatting requirements
- **Localization Considerations**: Space requirements for different languages
- **Dynamic Content**: How component handles changing text

#### **Media Content Requirements**
- **Image Specifications**: Dimensions, aspect ratios, file types
- **Alt Text Requirements**: Accessibility descriptions for images
- **Fallback Content**: What displays when media fails to load
- **Performance Considerations**: Optimization requirements

### 6. Technical Implementation Notes

#### **Development Guidance**
- **HTML Structure**: Semantic markup requirements
- **CSS Classes**: Naming conventions and structure
- **JavaScript Behavior**: Interactive functionality requirements
- **Accessibility Requirements**: ARIA labels, roles, and properties

#### **Integration Requirements**
- **Dependencies**: Other components or libraries required
- **API Connections**: External data or service integrations
- **Platform Constraints**: Specific technical limitations
- **Performance Considerations**: Loading and rendering requirements

### 7. Usage Documentation

#### **Implementation Examples**
- **Code Snippets**: Example HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Usage Patterns**: Common ways component is implemented
- **Integration Examples**: How component works with others
- **Customization Options**: Available configuration parameters

#### **Usage Guidelines**
- **When to Use**: Appropriate contexts for component
- **When Not to Use**: Situations where component is inappropriate
- **Best Practices**: Recommendations for optimal usage
- **Common Mistakes**: Pitfalls to avoid in implementation

### 8. References and Traceability

#### **Usage Tracking**
Maintain a comprehensive list of component usage:
- **Page References**: All pages where component appears
- **Synopsis Links**: Direct links to relevant synopsis documents
- **Sketch References**: Links to original sketches showing component
- **Story References**: Development stories that implement component

#### **Version History**
- **Change Log**: Record of modifications and rationale
- **Version Numbers**: Track component evolution
- **Impact Assessment**: How changes affect existing usage
- **Migration Notes**: Guidance for updating existing implementations

### 9. Quality Assurance

#### **Component Review Checklist**
- [ ] All states and variants are documented
- [ ] Behavioral specifications are complete and clear
- [ ] Content requirements are detailed enough for implementation
