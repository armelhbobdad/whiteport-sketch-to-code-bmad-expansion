# create-platform-infrastructure-epics

## Purpose

To create comprehensive epics and user stories for platform infrastructure, integrations, hosting, security, and all foundational systems that can be developed independently of UI decisions. This task enables parallel development streams by establishing the technical foundation while user research and interface design happen simultaneously.

## Process

The PM will analyze the Product Brief to identify all platform infrastructure requirements that form the technical foundation of the product, focusing on systems that can be built before UI specifications are complete.

### Identify Platform Infrastructure Requirements

* **Hosting & Deployment Infrastructure**: Cloud platforms, deployment pipelines, environment management
* **Authentication & User Management**: Login systems, user profiles, permissions, access control
* **External Integrations**: Google Workspace, Office 365, third-party APIs, enterprise systems
* **Database Architecture**: Data models, storage systems, backup, synchronization
* **Security Infrastructure**: Encryption, compliance, data protection, privacy controls
* **Performance Foundation**: Caching systems, optimization, scalability architecture
* **Monitoring & Operations**: Logging, analytics, performance tracking, maintenance tools

### Create Platform Infrastructure Epics

For each major infrastructure domain, create epics that group related foundational work:

* **Epic Structure**: Each epic should have a clear business value statement connecting to strategic objectives
* **Technical Scope**: Include hosting, security, integrations, and performance components
* **Success Criteria**: Define measurable outcomes for infrastructure readiness
* **API Specifications**: Design clear contracts that will support future UI development
* **Dependencies**: Identify prerequisites and connections between infrastructure components

### Break Down into Technical Stories

* **System Perspective Stories**: "As the system, I need to..." for core infrastructure
* **API Consumer Stories**: "As a frontend application, I need to..." for service contracts
* **Integration Stories**: "As an external service, I need to..." for third-party connections
* **Operations Stories**: "As a system administrator, I need to..." for maintenance and monitoring
* **Security Stories**: "As a security system, I need to..." for protection and compliance

### Prioritization and Sequencing

* **Foundation First**: Prioritize hosting, database, and core security that other components depend on
* **Integration Readiness**: Sequence external service connections for early testing and validation
* **API Preparation**: Ensure service contracts are ready when UI development begins
* **Risk Mitigation**: Address complex integrations and technical unknowns early in timeline
* **Parallel Enablement**: Structure work to minimize dependencies between infrastructure streams

## Elicitation Requirements

elicit: true
format: structured-interview

### Questions to Ask

1. **Hosting Requirements**: "What are the hosting, deployment, and infrastructure requirements for this platform?"

2. **Integration Landscape**: "What external systems, services, or APIs does this product need to integrate with? (Google, Office 365, enterprise systems, etc.)"

3. **Security & Compliance**: "What are the security, privacy, and compliance requirements? Are there industry standards or regulations to consider?"

4. **Performance Expectations**: "What are the expected user loads, response times, and scalability requirements for the platform?"

5. **Data Architecture**: "What data needs to be stored, processed, synchronized, or backed up? Are there existing data sources to integrate?"

6. **Authentication Strategy**: "How should users authenticate? Are there existing identity systems to integrate with?"

7. **Operational Requirements**: "What monitoring, logging, analytics, or maintenance capabilities are needed?"

8. **Technical Constraints**: "Are there existing systems, architectural standards, or technology constraints to work within?"

## Output Structure

The task creates two main documentation sections:

### **D-PRD/** (Product Requirements Document)
Strategic and technical specifications that define WHAT to build:
* **00-PRD-Overview.md** - Development context and references to Product Brief
* **01-Functional-Requirements.md** - Detailed feature specifications derived from Product Brief
* **02-API-Specifications.md** - Technical contracts and endpoint definitions
* **03-Data-Models.md** - Database schemas and data relationships
* **04-Integration-Specifications.md** - External system integration protocols
* **05-Performance-Requirements.md** - Benchmarks and scalability specifications
* **06-Security-Specifications.md** - Compliance and encryption details
* **07-Acceptance-Criteria.md** - Testable success definitions for all platform components

### **E-Backlog/** (Development Work Items)
Tactical development artifacts that define HOW and WHEN to build:
* **00-Implementation-Roadmap.md** - Development sequence, dependencies, and release planning
* **I01-Platform-Foundation/** - Initiative folder containing all platform infrastructure epics

#### **Naming Conventions:**
* **Initiatives**: I## prefix (I01, I02, etc.) - Business value outcomes that enable user scenarios
* **Epics**: E## prefix (E01, E02, etc.) - Value-focused names reflecting user benefits
* **Stories**: E##-S## prefix (E01-S01, E01-S02, etc.) - Individual development tasks with user value focus and epic inheritance
* **Overview Files**: Match folder names exactly (E01-Trusted-User-Access.md matches E01-Trusted-User-Access/ folder)
* **Story Files**: Use E##-S##-Descriptive-Name format following Title-Case-With-Dashes standard

#### **Value-Focused Naming:**
* Initiative names reflect what we BUILD to enable user scenarios (not what users do)
* Epic names focus on business value and user benefits (not technical components)
* Story names describe user value outcomes (not technical implementation details)

#### **Platform Infrastructure Initiative Structure:**

## Integration with Sketch-Driven Development

* **API-First Architecture**: Infrastructure stories define clear service contracts for future UI consumption
* **Foundation Readiness**: Core systems available when conceptual specification development begins
* **Parallel Development**: Backend infrastructure teams can work while UI design and user research proceed
* **Integration Preparation**: External service connections established and tested before UI implementation

## Success Criteria

The platform infrastructure epics and stories are successful when:
* All foundational systems from the product brief are covered with actionable development stories
* Technical dependencies are clearly identified and sequenced for efficient development
* API contracts are defined sufficiently for future UI development integration
* Infrastructure development can proceed immediately while user research and UI design happen in parallel
* Security, performance, and compliance requirements are systematically addressed
* External integrations are planned and prioritized for early risk mitigation

## Key Innovations

* **Infrastructure-First Approach**: Technical foundation established before UI decisions
* **Parallel Development Enablement**: Backend and frontend teams work simultaneously
* **Risk-Forward Planning**: Complex integrations and technical unknowns addressed early
* **API Contract Design**: Service specifications ready for future UI development
* **Strategic Foundation**: All infrastructure work connects to business objectives and user value
