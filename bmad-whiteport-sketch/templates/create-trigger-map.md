# create-trigger-map

## Purpose

To guide the user in creating a trigger map to identify and prioritize what a user needs in order to convert themselves and by getting their wishes fulfilled will by their usage provide business value. The trigger map serves as a foundation for identifying requirements.

## Process

The Analyst will manage a workshop with key stakeholders and ask a few specific questions. The answer to each question leads to the next. The model is based on the Effect Mapping method created by Inuse in Sweden.

1.  **Define Business Goals**: Ask the user, "What are the business goals?" The answer defines the larger good the interactive solution should contribute to.
2.  **Identify Target Groups**: Ask the user, "Who, in the world, will, by using the system in the intended way, ensure that the business goals are fulfilled?" The answer determines which target groups the system should be designed for.
3.  **Define User Goals**: Ask each user, "Why are you using this product? What do you as a user want to happen and what do you, with the help of the software manage to avoid when faced with using the software?" The defined usage goals are defined and prioritized. As a positive goal, what they want and a negative goal what they want to avoid.
4.  **Prioritization**: Each business goal, user group and usage goal is prioritized.

## Output

A well-organized hierarchical list or mind map, of the users desired outcomes and situations avoided sorted by importance and impact on the business. The most important function, fulfilling the goals of the primary target group, should be developed first.

## Document Application and Usage

* The trigger map is designed to be a living document used for managing the expectations of the project.
* After the product has been tested with users, the map can also be used as a script for evaluating the end product.
* For example, if a user's goal is "to feel sure they are not making any mistakes," this can be defined as a positive user goal. This goal can then be used to create questions for a test subject during a user testing session.

## Defining Business Goals: Soft and Hard Goals

The Analyst will guide the user in defining goals in a tree structure, starting with a Soft Goal and then defining the Hard Goals that prove it is being fulfilled.

* **Soft Goals**: The Analyst should first ask for the overall goals of the project in simple terms. These are verbalized as a qualitative description that communicates the ambition of the product, such as "Best on the market," "Most convenient choice," or "Top of mind for..."
* **Hard Goals**: Next, the Analyst will focus on the hard goals, which are measurable and act as proof that the soft goal is being fulfilled. These could mean "top ranking," "X number of views," or "Y number of users." The hard goals can be formulated in accordance with the "SMART" goal method.
* **Validation**: Before moving on, the Analyst should double-check if the user agrees that filling the hard goals would indeed be a satisfactory way to fulfill the soft goals.

## Defining Target Groups

The purpose of this process is to find the most valuable user groups that the product should be designed for and prioritize them. The principle is that the needs of the most prioritized group should take precedence in any design decision.

* **Identification**: Target groups represent the intersection between a general user group (e.g., customers, travelers) and their unique demographics or characteristics (e.g., tourists, commuters). The analyst should ensure that the needs of these groups are real and that the groups are clearly distinguishable from one another.
* **Naming**: It helps if the names of the groups are memorable and rhyming, such as "Stuart Student" or "Peg the Pensioner."
* **Description**: Each group should have a description that details their user type, demographics, and special interests.
* **Prioritization**: We usually try to identify the three to five most important target groups, as having more might be distracting. The needs of the most prioritized group should always be the focus of the design.

## Defining Usage Goals

The Trigger map differs from other workshop methods in its focus on **Usage Goals**. This unique method focuses on the user's ultimate buying decisions, which are often driven by emotional content.

* **Emotional Focus**: The Analyst will ask the general question, "What do these users want to have happen as a consequence of interacting with the product?" The answers should be primarily emotional in nature.
* **Positive and Negative Goals**: The answers should be in a positive or negative form. Positive usage goals are the vision-based driving forces behind the interaction, while negative goals describe what the user wishes to avoid. For example, "becoming wealthy" and "not staying poor" are technically the same, but in an interactive product, the design, content, and imagery might be radically different for each formulation.
* **Structured Questions**: The Analyst can choose to separate the questions into two parts: first identifying the positive driving forces by asking, "What do these users want?" and then following up by asking, "What do they wish to avoid?"
