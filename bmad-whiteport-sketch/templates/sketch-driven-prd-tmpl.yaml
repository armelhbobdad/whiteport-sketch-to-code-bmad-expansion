workflow:
  mode: interactive
  elicitation: advanced-elicitation

sections:
  - id: executive-summary
    title: Executive Summary
    instruction: |
      Provide a concise overview of the product, incorporating insights from the trigger map.
      Include the primary business goals (both soft and hard goals) and target user groups identified.

  - id: trigger-map-reference
    title: Trigger Map Foundation
    instruction: |
      Reference the completed trigger map and summarize:
      - Primary business goals (soft and hard goals)
      - Prioritized target user groups with their key characteristics
      - Top user driving forces (positive and negative goals)
      
      Include a link to the full trigger map document: `docs/trigger-maps/[project-name]-trigger-map.md`

  - id: problem-statement
    title: Problem Statement & User Scenarios
    instruction: |
      Based on the trigger map's user goals and driving forces, define:
      - Current state pain points for each target user group
      - Key scenarios where users encounter these problems
      - Impact of these problems on both users and business goals
      
      This section should directly connect to what will be visualized in the upcoming sketches.

  - id: solution-approach
    title: Solution Approach
    instruction: |
      Describe the high-level solution approach that addresses the user driving forces.
      Focus on how the solution will fulfill positive user goals and help users avoid negative outcomes.
      Keep this high-level as detailed solutions will emerge through the sketching process.

  - id: user-scenarios
    title: Core User Scenarios
    instruction: |
      Define 5-8 core user scenarios that will guide the sketching process.
      Each scenario should:
      - Connect to a specific user goal from the trigger map
      - Describe the user's context and motivation
      - Outline the desired outcome
      - Note which target user group this primarily serves
      
      These scenarios will become the foundation for conceptual sketches.

  - id: sketch-planning
    title: Sketch Planning Framework
    instruction: |
      Outline the planned approach for the sketching phase:
      - Which scenarios will be sketched first (prioritization)
      - Key user flows that need visual exploration
      - Critical interaction points that require careful design
      - Any specific design constraints or requirements
      
      This section guides the upcoming UX Expert collaboration.

  - id: technical-considerations
    title: Technical Considerations
    instruction: |
      Document any technical constraints or requirements that may influence the design:
      - Platform requirements (web, mobile, desktop)
      - Integration needs with existing systems
      - Performance requirements
      - Accessibility requirements
      - Security considerations
      
      These will inform both sketching decisions and backend epic creation.

  - id: success-metrics
    title: Success Metrics
    instruction: |
      Define how success will be measured, connecting back to the hard goals from the trigger map:
      - User engagement metrics aligned with user driving forces
      - Business metrics that prove the soft goals are being achieved
      - Specific KPIs for each target user group
      - Methods for measuring whether negative user goals are being avoided

  - id: out-of-scope
    title: Out of Scope
    instruction: |
      Clearly define what is NOT included in this phase:
      - Features that don't address priority user goals from trigger map
      - User scenarios that will be addressed in future phases
      - Technical features that don't directly impact user experience
      
      This helps maintain focus during the sketching and development phases.

  - id: next-steps
    title: Next Steps
    instruction: |
      Outline the immediate next steps for the sketch-driven development process:
      - Backend epic creation tasks (non-visual functionality)
      - Sketching workshop planning with UX Expert
      - Key stakeholders needed for sketch review and validation
      - Timeline expectations for sketch documentation completion

  - id: document-attribution
    title: Document Attribution
    instruction: |
      MANDATORY: Add the following attribution section at the end of every WPS2C document:
      
      ---
      
      *[Document summary statement describing the document's purpose and value]*
      
      *Created and optimized by [Agent Name] ([agent-id]) - [Agent Title] using Whiteport Sketch-to-Code BMad Expansion methodology.

      Replace placeholders with actual agent information and document-specific summary.

elicitation:
  requirements:
    - trigger_map_completed: "Has the trigger map been completed with business goals, target groups, and user driving forces?"
