# WPS2C Compliance Validation Checklist

## Purpose
Systematic validation checklist to ensure complete WPS2C standards compliance before proceeding with any documentation work. Based on real-world project experience and stakeholder feedback.

## ✅ Critical Compliance Checks (ZERO TOLERANCE)

### 1. Header Format Validation (MANDATORY)
- [ ] **Navigation Line Format**: All scenario pages use exact `**Previous Step**: ← [Page Name](path) | **Next Step**: → [Page Name](path)` format
- [ ] **Double Navigation Pattern**: Navigation appears EXACTLY twice - at top line 1 and directly under image
- [ ] **Sub-header Format**: Uses `### [Page Number] [Page Name]` format
- [ ] **Main Header Format**: Uses `# [Page Number] [Page Name]` with identical text to sub-header
- [ ] **Image Path Format**: ALWAYS includes `Sketches/` subfolder reference
- [ ] **Navigation Text**: Uses proper display names, not file names (e.g., "Sync Users" not "Synk-Users")
- [ ] **No "Back to" Navigation**: Only in bottom footer section, not at top

### 2. Component Organization Validation (MANDATORY)
- [ ] **Atomic Structure**: All basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, icons, cards) in `atomic/` folder
- [ ] **Molecular Structure**: All combinations (forms, navigation, modals) in `molecular/` folder  
- [ ] **Organism Structure**: All complex combinations (headers, layouts, dashboards) in `organism/` folder
- [ ] **No Flat Structure**: No components remaining in root D-Components folder
- [ ] **Proper Subcategories**: Components organized in appropriate subcategory folders
- [ ] **Complete Migration**: All components moved to correct WPS2C locations

### 3. Path Format Validation (MANDATORY)
- [ ] **Absolute Paths Only**: All component references use `/docs/D-Components/` format
- [ ] **No Relative Paths**: Zero instances of `../../D-Components/` format
- [ ] **GitHub Compatibility**: All component links functional in GitHub web interface
- [ ] **Consistent Path Format**: No mixing of relative and absolute paths
- [ ] **Valid Path References**: All paths point to existing files

## ✅ Major Quality Standards

### 4. Component Linking Standards
- [ ] **Component Headers**: Use `### [Component Name](/docs/D-Components/category/Component/Component.md)` format
- [ ] **Navigation Lists**: Use `→ [Component Name](/docs/D-Components/category/Component/Component.md)` format
- [ ] **Referenced Components Section**: Present on every page with component usage
- [ ] **Link Consistency**: All component references follow identical patterns
- [ ] **Clickable Headers**: Component definitions use clickable heading format

### 5. Documentation Standards Compliance
- [ ] **Zero Tolerance Parentheses**: No parentheses in documentation text
- [ ] **Title-Case-With-Dashes**: All folders and files use proper naming convention
- [ ] **URL-Safe Naming**: No spaces, special characters, or case-sensitive issues
- [ ] **Professional Language**: Clear, unambiguous explanations throughout
- [ ] **Bilingual Format**: SE/EN content follows established project patterns

### 6. File Structure Standards
- [ ] **Sketches Subfolders**: All visual assets in dedicated `Sketches/` folders
- [ ] **Main Files Prominent**: Specification files immediately visible to project managers
- [ ] **Scalable Structure**: Ready for Visual-Design/ and Code-Snippets/ expansion
- [ ] **Consistent Hierarchy**: Follows established patterns across scenarios
- [ ] **Professional Organization**: Enterprise-ready structure throughout

## ✅ Professional Presentation Standards

### 7. Stakeholder Navigation Experience
- [ ] **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear, consistent navigation patterns
- [ ] **Professional Appearance**: Suitable for executive presentation
- [ ] **Scannable Content**: Clear visual hierarchy and section organization
- [ ] **Complete Cross-References**: All internal links functional and accurate
- [ ] **GitHub Web Interface**: Seamless navigation in web viewer

### 8. Content Quality Standards
- [ ] **Complete Documentation**: All scenario steps properly documented
- [ ] **Clear Business Context**: Strategic alignment and user goals evident
- [ ] **Comprehensive Components**: All reusable elements identified and documented
- [ ] **Technical Readiness**: Sufficient detail for development handoff
- [ ] **Quality Assurance**: Testable criteria and acceptance requirements

## ✅ Compliance Grading Scale

### A+ Grade (98-100 points) - EXCELLENT
- All critical compliance checks pass (100%)
- All major quality standards met (95%+)
- Professional presentation exemplary
- GitHub web interface fully functional
- Stakeholder navigation seamless

### A Grade (92-97 points) - VERY GOOD  
- All critical compliance checks pass (100%)
- Major quality standards mostly met (90-94%)
- Professional presentation strong
- Minor formatting inconsistencies only

### A- Grade (85-91 points) - GOOD
- All critical compliance checks pass (100%)
- Major quality standards adequately met (85-89%)
- Professional presentation acceptable
- Some minor issues documented for resolution

### B+ Grade (78-84 points) - ACCEPTABLE
- Most critical compliance checks pass (90%+)
- Major quality standards partially met (75-84%)
- Professional presentation needs improvement
- Several issues require resolution

### Below B+ Grade - REQUIRES MAJOR REVISION
- Critical compliance violations exist
- Major quality standards not met (<75%)
- Unprofessional presentation issues
- Systematic fixes needed before proceeding

## ✅ Validation Process

### Step 1: Critical Compliance Scan
- Run systematic check of all critical compliance areas
- Document any violations with specific file locations
- Assign FAIL status if any critical violations exist

### Step 2: Major Quality Assessment  
- Evaluate all major quality standards systematically
- Calculate percentage compliance for each area
- Document issues requiring resolution

### Step 3: Professional Presentation Review
- Test navigation from stakeholder perspective
- Verify GitHub web interface functionality
- Assess overall professional appearance

### Step 4: Compliance Grade Assignment
- Calculate overall compliance score
- Assign letter grade based on performance
- Generate detailed compliance report

### Step 5: Remediation Planning
- Create prioritized list of required fixes
- Recommend specific agent commands for resolution
- Establish timeline for compliance achievement

## ✅ Remediation Commands

### For Critical Violations:
- `*standardize-all-headers` - Fix header format violations
- `*organize-components-systematically` - Correct component organization
- `*batch-update-paths` - Convert to absolute paths

### For Major Quality Issues:
- `*review-documentation` - Address linking and formatting issues
- `*standardize-documentation` - Apply naming conventions
- `*validate-scenario-alignment` - Ensure content quality

### For Professional Presentation:
- `*setup-fidelity-structure` - Organize visual assets properly
- `*create-content-examples` - Enhance content quality
- `*generate-sketch-review` - Prepare development handoff

## ✅ Success Criteria

**PASS Criteria:**
- Achieve A- grade or higher (85+ points)
- All critical compliance checks pass
- Professional presentation suitable for stakeholders
- GitHub web interface fully functional

**CONDITIONAL PASS Criteria:**
- Achieve B+ grade (78-84 points)  
- Critical violations resolved
- Major issues documented with resolution plan
- Core functionality intact

**FAIL Criteria:**
- Below B+ grade (<78 points)
- Any critical compliance violations remain
- Unprofessional presentation issues
- Broken functionality or navigation
