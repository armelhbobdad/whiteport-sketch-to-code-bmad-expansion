## Common Violation Patterns to Avoid

### High-Frequency Issues (Based on Actimate Experience)

1. **Parentheses Overuse** - Most common violation across all documents
   - Platform references: `(iOS/Android)` → `for iOS and Android`
   - Time estimates: `(3 days)` → `- 3 days`
   - Examples: `(Walk, Gym, Sports)` → `such as Walk, Gym, Sports`

2. **Inconsistent Time Formatting** - Second most common issue
   - Mixed formats: `(2 days)`, `2-day`, `2 days` → `- 2 days`
   - Inconsistent structure across implementation steps

3. **Casual Language** - Professional tone violations
   - Informal expressions and conversational asides
   - Ambiguous or vague technical specifications

4. **Incomplete Feasibility Analysis** - Missing critical components
   - BMad acceleration factors not specified
   - Required competencies not documented
   - Risk assessments incomplete or missing

5. **Poor Cross-Reference Management** - Documentation integration issues
   - Broken internal links and references
   - Inconsistent section naming across documents

## Remediation Strategies

### Systematic Review Process

1. **Automated Scanning**: Use tools to identify parentheses violations
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Look for common violation patterns
3. **Section-by-Section Review**: Systematic page-by-page examination
4. **Cross-Document Validation**: Ensure consistency across entire suite
5. **Stakeholder Review**: Final validation with technical and business teams

### Quality Improvement Workflow

1. **Initial Assessment**: Identify violation types and frequency
2. **Priority Ranking**: Address highest-impact issues first
3. **Systematic Remediation**: Fix violations using established patterns
4. **Validation Testing**: Verify fixes maintain technical accuracy
5. **Final Review**: Comprehensive quality assurance check
