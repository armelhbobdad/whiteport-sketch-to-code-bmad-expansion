# Sketch Review Process Checklist

## Purpose
Ensure surgical editing approach when updating documentation based on sketch revisions, preventing unnecessary content churn while maintaining documentation quality.

## Phase 1: Change Identification & Analysis

### 1. Visual Comparison
- [ ] Compare new sketch against current documentation
- [ ] Identify specific visual elements that are different
- [ ] Note any new components, features, or interactions
- [ ] Document any removed or relocated elements

### 2. Gap Documentation
- [ ] List exact additions needed in documentation
- [ ] Identify modifications required for existing sections
- [ ] Note any terminology or labeling changes
- [ ] Assess impact on navigation and user flows

### 3. Preservation Assessment
- [ ] Identify existing content that should remain untouched
- [ ] Mark sections with stable, well-crafted specifications
- [ ] Preserve carefully written interaction descriptions
- [ ] Maintain successful content structure and messaging

### 4. Change Scope Definition
- [ ] Create specific list of targeted changes required
- [ ] Estimate impact (minimal, moderate, significant)
- [ ] Identify which files/sections need updates
- [ ] Flag any potential cascade effects to other pages

## Phase 2: User Approval & Planning

### 5. Present Change Analysis
- [ ] Show user the specific differences identified
- [ ] Present proposed minimal changes list
- [ ] Highlight what existing content will be preserved
- [ ] Request confirmation before proceeding

### 6. Surgical Edit Planning
- [ ] Plan exact insertion points for new content
- [ ] Define minimal modification scope for existing sections
- [ ] Identify specific text strings to update
- [ ] Map changes to preserve existing formatting and structure

## Phase 3: Surgical Implementation

### 7. Targeted Content Updates
- [ ] Add only new/changed elements to documentation
- [ ] Modify only affected sections with minimal edits
- [ ] Preserve existing working specifications intact
- [ ] Maintain established content voice and style

### 8. Quality Assurance
- [ ] Verify changes address identified sketch differences
- [ ] Confirm existing content remains untouched where appropriate
- [ ] Check that additions integrate seamlessly with existing content
- [ ] Validate navigation and cross-references still work

### 9. Change Documentation
- [ ] Clearly show what was changed vs what was preserved
- [ ] Document reasoning for any larger modifications
- [ ] Note any cascade updates required in related files
- [ ] Provide summary of changes for review

## Phase 4: Validation & Completion

### 10. Content Review
- [ ] Verify sketch requirements are fully addressed
- [ ] Confirm no unnecessary rewrites occurred
- [ ] Check that content quality and clarity maintained
- [ ] Validate technical accuracy of new specifications

### 11. Cross-Reference Check
- [ ] Update any affected navigation links
- [ ] Verify component references remain accurate
- [ ] Check scenario flow integrity maintained
- [ ] Confirm image references point to correct files

### 12. Final Approval
- [ ] Present changes for user review
- [ ] Confirm surgical approach was successful
- [ ] Get approval before committing changes
- [ ] Document lessons learned for future sketch reviews

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Wholesale Rewrites
- DON'T rewrite entire sections when small additions suffice
- DON'T replace concise, clear text with verbose "bla bla"
- DON'T modify working specifications unnecessarily
- DON'T lose carefully crafted content for minimal improvements

### ❌ Scope Creep
- DON'T add features not shown in the sketch
- DON'T improve unrelated documentation sections
- DON'T reorganize content structure without specific need
- DON'T introduce new terminology without approval

### ❌ Change Without Approval
- DON'T implement changes before user confirms scope
- DON'T assume extensive modifications are desired
- DON'T proceed without clear understanding of requirements
- DON'T make changes that affect other pages without notification

## Success Criteria

### ✅ Minimal Impact Implementation
- Only affected sections show changes in version control
- Existing quality content remains completely intact
- New content integrates seamlessly with established patterns
- Change scope matches exactly what sketch requires

### ✅ Quality Preservation
- Documentation maintains consistent voice and style
- Technical accuracy improved without losing clarity
- User experience specifications remain comprehensive
- Content structure and organization preserved

### ✅ Efficient Process
- Changes completed quickly with focused edits
- User approval obtained before implementation
- Clear change documentation for future reference
- Process can be repeated consistently for future sketches

## Notes
- This checklist ensures documentation evolution remains controlled and purposeful
- Surgical editing preserves investment in existing quality content
- User approval prevents misaligned expectations and unnecessary work
- Focus on precision over comprehensive rewriting maintains project momentum
