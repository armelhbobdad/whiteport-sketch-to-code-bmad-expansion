# 01. Whiteport Product Brief Discovery Method

## Overview

The Product Brief Discovery Method is a conversational approach to establishing strategic project foundations through adaptive questioning and progressive document building. This method transforms traditional requirements gathering into an engaging dialogue that builds understanding and alignment.

## Core Principles

### Conversational Discovery
- **Open-ended Starting Point**: Begin with "Can you describe the project you're working on in your own words?"
- **Adaptive Follow-up**: Use contextual questions based on what the user reveals
- **Natural Flow**: Let the conversation evolve organically while ensuring comprehensive coverage

### Progressive Document Building
- **Live Updates**: Add content to the brief after each user response
- **Visible Progress**: Users see the document growing in real-time
- **Iterative Refinement**: Encourage review and feedback throughout the process

### Supportive Facilitation
- **Positive Reflection**: Acknowledge and build upon each user response
- **Option to Skip**: Always offer to skip questions if users are uncertain
- **Helpful Suggestions**: Provide examples when users struggle to answer

## Process Flow

### Step 1: Opening Discovery
**Question**: "Can you describe the project you're working on in your own words?"

**Purpose**: Establish baseline understanding and communication style
**Outcome**: Initial project context and user perspective

### Step 2: Foundational Questions
Cover these areas through adaptive follow-up questions:

#### Project Context & Nature
- User terminology and naming conventions
- Product type and technical scope
- Greenfield vs brownfield development
- Standalone vs integrated system architecture

#### Organizational Context
- Key stakeholders and decision makers
- Project drivers and motivations
- Timeline expectations and urgency
- Resource availability and constraints

#### Market & Competitive Context
- Existing solutions and competitors
- Current user problem-solving approaches
- Differentiation factors and unique value
- Market positioning and strategy

#### Success & Measurement Context
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Failure scenarios and risks
- Business impact requirements
- Measurement and validation approaches

#### Technical & Platform Context
- Integration requirements and constraints
- Technology standards and preferences
- Maintenance and operational considerations
- Long-term technical strategy

### Step 3: Content Creation
**After foundational discovery**: Analyst proactively creates product brief sections based on gathered information

**Key Difference**: Unlike trigger map process, this does NOT continue step-by-step elicitation after discovery

## Facilitation Guidelines

### Question Pacing
- **One Question at a Time**: Never flood users with multiple questions
- **Wait for Response**: Allow full user input before proceeding
- **Acknowledge Each Answer**: Respond positively and insightfully to each response

### Progress Management
- **Update Brief After Each Response**: Show visible progress
- **Use Progress Indicators**: "Only a few more questions," "We're almost there"
- **Varied Update Language**: Change how you announce updates - "I'll capture this insight," "Let me add this information"

### User Support
- **Encourage Skipping**: "No worries if you're not sure about this - we can come back to it later"
- **Provide Examples**: "Like a mobile app, web platform, internal system, API - what feels right for your context?"
- **Build on Previous Information**: Reference earlier answers to create connections

### Content Restrictions
- **Skip Financial Questions**: Avoid budget and resource questions in foundational discovery
- **Focus on Strategic Foundation**: Concentrate on vision, users, problems, and high-level solutions
- **Save Technical Details**: Reserve implementation specifics for later phases

## Expected Outcomes

### Primary Deliverable
**Product Brief Document** (`Docs/A. Product Brief/brief.md`) containing:
- Executive summary and project vision
- Problem statement and market opportunity
- Target user types and high-level personas
- Solution approach and technical architecture
- Success criteria and strategic goals
- Development priorities and next steps

### Secondary Benefits
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Shared understanding of project direction
- **Communication Foundation**: Established terminology and concepts
- **Decision Framework**: Clear criteria for future choices
- **Team Preparation**: Ready foundation for detailed user research

## Integration with Other Methods

### Followed by Trigger Map Workshop
Product brief provides input for business goals and target group identification in trigger map development

### Feeds into Persona Development
User types defined in brief become foundation for detailed persona creation

### Informs Technical Planning
Architecture and platform decisions guide technical requirement specification

## Success Criteria

### Process Quality
- User feels heard and understood throughout conversation
- Questions feel natural and purposeful, not like interrogation
- Document grows organically and demonstrates real listening
- User confirms satisfaction with brief before proceeding

### Output Quality
- Brief provides clear strategic direction for project
- All major stakeholders can understand and align with content
- Document serves as effective foundation for detailed user research
- Technical and business teams have shared reference point

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Rushing to Technical Details**: Keep focus on strategic foundation
- **Assuming User Knowledge**: Don't skip explanations or examples
- **Generic Templates**: Customize questions based on user responses
- **Batch Questioning**: Maintain one-question-at-a-time discipline
- **Premature Conclusion**: Ensure user satisfaction before moving to trigger map phase
