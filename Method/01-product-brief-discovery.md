### 🔗 Your Foundation in the Whiteport Sketch-to-Code Method
This is **Phase A** of the complete WPS2C workflow - the strategic foundation that makes everything else possible. Without this conversational discovery, your trigger maps lack business context, your sketches miss user insights, and your code serves no clear purpose. This phase transforms stakeholder conversations into the strategic compass that guides your entire project from vision to deployment.

The Product Brief Discovery in the Whiteport Sketch To Code Method is a conversational approach to establishing strategic project foundations through adaptive questioning and progressive document building. This method transforms traditional requirements gathering into an engaging dialogue that builds understanding and alignment.

## 🚀 WHY This Changes Everything

### The Traditional Requirements
**Ever been in this meeting?** 📋
- Business analyst with 47-question spreadsheet
- Stakeholders glazing over by question 12
- Everyone saying "yes" just to end the torture
- Final document nobody actually reads or uses

**Here's the painful truth**: Traditional requirements gathering treats humans like databases. We interrogate instead of inspire. We extract instead of explore. We assume instead of understand.

### The WPS2C Method: What If Requirements Could Be... Fun? 🎉

**Imagine this instead:**
- Stakeholders excited to share their vision
- Documents that grow organically through real conversation  
- Everyone leaving energized and aligned
- A strategic foundation people actually reference daily

**This isn't just better requirements - it's better business relationships.**

## 🛠️ HOW WPS2C Discovery Transforms the Game

### Traditional Approach vs WPS2C Magic ✨

| 😵 Traditional Requirements | 🎯 WPS2C Discovery |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| 47 pre-written questions | One question: "Tell me about your project" |
| Analyst extracts answers | Conversation reveals insights |
| Document created after meeting | Document grows during conversation |
| Generic template approach | Adaptive, human-centered flow |
| Stakeholders endure process | Stakeholders drive the discovery |
| Focus on "what" and "how" | Start with "why" and "who" |

### The Customer Awareness Journey We Create 🎭

**🔍 Unaware Stage**: "I need an app"
- **Traditional**: What features? What technology? What timeline?
- **WPS2C**: Why does this matter to you? What problem are you solving?

**⚡ Problem Aware**: "Our current process is broken"
- **Traditional**: How do we fix the current system?
- **WPS2C**: Who struggles most with this? What would success feel like?

**💡 Solution Aware**: "We need a digital solution"
- **Traditional**: Here's our standard platform options
- **WPS2C**: What's unique about your approach? How do you want to differentiate?

**🎯 Product Aware**: "We understand our vision"
- **Traditional**: Let's document 47 requirements
- **WPS2C**: How do we create something people actually love using?

## 🎪 WHAT You Get: The WPS2C Discovery Experience

### The Magic Opening Move 🎭
**Instead of**: "Please complete this requirements questionnaire"
**WPS2C says**: *"Can you describe the project you're working on in your own words?"*

**Why this works**: People light up when asked to share their vision. They become collaborators, not interrogation subjects.

### The Progressive Revelation Process 📈

#### 🎯 Step 1: The Golden Question
**"Tell me about your project in your own words"**

**What happens**:
- Stakeholders share their passion and vision
- Real priorities naturally emerge
- You discover what they actually care about
- Conversation energy flows instead of drains

**Behind the scenes**: You're listening for Golden Circle elements:
- **WHY**: What's their deeper purpose?
- **HOW**: What makes their approach unique?
- **WHAT**: What specific outcomes matter most?

#### 🔍 Step 2: The Intelligent Follow-Up Dance
**Instead of rigid questionnaire, you adapt to what they reveal**

**If they mention users**: "Who specifically benefits from this?"
**If they mention problems**: "What's the cost of not solving this?"
**If they mention competition**: "What makes your approach different?"
**If they mention timeline**: "What's driving that urgency?"

**The secret**: Each answer reveals the next question. It's jazz, not classical music.

#### 📋 Step 3: The Living Document Magic
**As you talk, the Product Brief grows in real-time**

**Traditional**: "We'll send you the document next week"
**WPS2C**: "Let me capture what you just said... *types actively* ...does this reflect your thinking?"

**What this creates**:
- ✨ Immediate validation and refinement
- 🔄 Real-time course correction
- 🎯 Stakeholder ownership of content
- 💡 "Yes, exactly!" moments that build trust

### The Strategic Foundation You Build 🏗️

**Your Product Brief becomes**:
- 📖 **Executive Summary**: The vision that inspires teams
- 🎯 **Problem Statement**: The "why" that drives decisions  
- 👥 **User Types**: The "who" that guides design
- 🛠️ **Solution Approach**: The "how" that enables development
- 📊 **Success Criteria**: The "what" that measures progress

**But more importantly**: Everyone believes in it because they helped create it.

## 🎬 The Step-by-Step Performance Guide

### 🎭 Act 1: The Opening (5-10 minutes)
**Your role**: Curious consultant, not interrogating investigator

**Script starter**: 
*"I'm excited to understand your vision. Can you tell me about this project in your own words? What matters most to you about making this successful?"*

**Director's notes**:
- 👂 Listen for passion and energy
- 🎯 Note what they emphasize naturally
- 💭 Watch for what excites them vs what stresses them
- 📝 Capture their exact language and terminology

### 🎭 Act 2: The Adaptive Exploration (15-30 minutes)
**Your role**: Master conversation conductor

**The secret sauce**: Follow their energy, don't fight it
- If they love talking about users → Dive deeper into user insights
- If they're excited about technology → Explore technical innovation  
- If they're focused on business impact → Understand market dynamics
- If they're worried about competition → Discover differentiation factors

**Sample conversation flow**:

**Stakeholder**: *"We want to help local restaurants connect with customers better"*

**You**: *"That's fascinating! What specific challenges are restaurants facing right now? What does 'better connection' look like in practice?"*

**Stakeholder**: *"Most small restaurants can't afford the big delivery apps, but customers expect digital ordering"*

**You**: *"Ah, so there's a cost barrier preventing access to digital tools. Who specifically are you thinking about when you say 'small restaurants'? Paint me a picture of your ideal restaurant partner."*

**Live Document Update**: 
*"Let me capture this insight... [types] ...it sounds like your core mission is democratizing digital ordering for independent restaurants who are priced out of major platforms. Does that resonate?"*

### 🎭 Act 3: The Strategic Synthesis (10-15 minutes)
**Your role**: Strategic translator

**What you're doing**:
- 🔄 Reflecting back their vision in organized form
- 🎯 Connecting dots they shared across different topics
- 💡 Highlighting insights they might not have seen
- 📋 Building the foundation for next phases

**Sample synthesis**:
*"Here's what I'm hearing as your core strategy: You're creating a affordable digital ordering platform specifically for independent restaurants, targeting the 78% of local eateries who can't justify $300/month for existing solutions. Your differentiation is community-focused features that major platforms don't offer. Sound right?"*

**Avoid This**:
- Silent note-taking followed by "we'll send you the document"

### 🎯 Navigate the Strategic Balance
