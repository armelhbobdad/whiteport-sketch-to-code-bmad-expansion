# Design System Integration

## Overview

The Design System Integration phase bridges the gap between creative sketching and technical implementation by establishing a centralized, component-based design system that enables efficient collaboration between designers, developers, and stakeholders. This phase transforms hand-drawn sketches into a systematic, maintainable design system that scales with the project.

## Purpose

To create a comprehensive design system that:
- **Centralizes styling** through CSS design tokens and component classes
- **Integrates with chosen component library** for rapid component development
- **Enables realistic design creation** in Figma using actual component specifications
- **Facilitates GitHub collaboration** for efficient team workflows
- **Generates working prototypes** for immediate design validation

## The Design System Workflow

### Phase 1: Design System Foundation

#### **Centralized CSS System**
Create a single source of truth for all styling:

```css
/* Design Tokens */
:root {
  --color-primary: #3b82f6;
  --color-secondary: #64748b;
  --spacing-sm: 0.5rem;
  --spacing-md: 1rem;
  --spacing-lg: 2rem;
  --font-family-primary: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  --font-size-sm: 0.875rem;
  --font-size-md: 1rem;
  --font-size-lg: 1.25rem;
}

/* Component Classes */
.btn-primary {
  background-color: var(--color-primary);
  padding: var(--spacing-sm) var(--spacing-md);
  font-family: var(--font-family-primary);
  font-size: var(--font-size-md);
}
```

#### **Component Library Structure**
Organize components using atomic design principles:

```
docs/D-Components/
├── 00-Design-System/
│   ├── index.html              # Interactive brand book
│   ├── dogweek-theme.css       # Centralized CSS
│   └── Dog-Week-Design-System.md
├── atomic/
│   ├── Interactive/
│   │   └── CTA-Button-Primary/
│   └── Typography/
│       └── Heading-H1/
├── molecular/
│   └── Forms/
│       └── Contact-Form/
└── organism/
    └── Headers/
        └── Main-Header/
```

### Phase 2: Component Library Integration

#### **Component Mapping Process**
1. **Analyze sketch elements** to identify UI components
2. **Select appropriate components** from chosen library for each element
3. **Document component variants** and customization needs
4. **Create component specifications** with chosen library integration

#### **Example Component Specification**
```markdown
# CTA Button Primary Component

## Component Library Integration
**Component Library ID**: `Button`  
**Variant**: `default` (primary styling)  
**Size**: `lg` (large for family-friendly touch targets)  
**Import**: `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"`

## Design Tokens
- **Background**: `bg-blue-500` (primary brand color)
- **Hover**: `hover:bg-blue-600` (darker on hover)
- **Text**: `text-white` (high contrast)
- **Padding**: `py-4 px-8` (family-friendly touch targets)

## Code Example
```typescript
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

<Button size="lg" className="w-full bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white py-4 px-8 rounded-lg">
  Start sharing the dog walks - it's free forever
</Button>
```

### Phase 3: Interactive Brand Book

#### **Component Showcase**
Create an interactive web-based brand book that displays:
- **All components** with their variants and states
- **Code examples** for each component
- **Usage guidelines** and best practices
- **Responsive examples** across different screen sizes

#### **Team Collaboration Features**
- **Designer tools**: Component selection and design guidelines
- **Developer tools**: Implementation code and API reference
- **Stakeholder tools**: Visual approval and brand consistency

### Phase 4: Gray Model Generation

#### **Working Prototypes**
Generate functional HTML/CSS prototypes that:
- **Use actual component specifications** from the design system
- **Implement chosen library components** with custom styling
- **Include responsive design** across all breakpoints
- **Support bilingual content** (English/Swedish)

#### **Prototype Features**
- **Interactive elements**: Working buttons, forms, and navigation
- **Language switching**: Toggle between English and Swedish
- **Responsive testing**: Test across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Design validation**: Immediate visual feedback on design decisions

## GitHub Collaboration Workflow

### **Repository Structure**
```
project/
├── docs/
│   ├── C-Scenarios/           # Scenario specifications
│   └── D-Components/          # Design system components
├── components/
│   └── ui/                    # Component library components
├── styles/
│   └── globals.css            # Centralized CSS
└── prototypes/                # Working prototypes
```

### **Team Workflow**
1. **Designers**: Use brand book to select components, create realistic designs in Figma
2. **Developers**: Reference component specifications for implementation
3. **Stakeholders**: Review interactive brand book for approval
4. **Team**: Collaborate through GitHub with clear version control

## Figma Integration Strategy

### **Design System in Figma**
- **Component library**: Create Figma components matching CSS system
- **Design tokens**: Use consistent colors, typography, and spacing
- **Responsive frames**: Design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **State variants**: Include hover, active, disabled states

### **Figma-to-Code Workflow**
