# üèóÔ∏è Phase 3: PRD Platform Infrastructure Method

---

## Overview

The Platform Infrastructure Planning Method creates comprehensive epics and stories for all foundational systems, integrations, and backend infrastructure that can be developed independently of UI decisions. This method enables parallel development streams by establishing the technical foundation while user research and UI design happen simultaneously.

## Core Principles

### Infrastructure-First Development
- **Foundation Before Interface**: Build core systems before UI sketching begins
- **Parallel Development**: Enable backend and frontend teams to work simultaneously
- **Risk Mitigation**: Address technical complexity and integrations early in the project

### Strategic Analysis
- **Product Brief Foundation**: Extract all technical requirements from strategic documentation
- **Integration Identification**: Catalog all external systems, APIs, and third-party services
- **Performance Planning**: Establish scalability, security, and performance foundations

### Epic-Driven Organization
- **Business Value Connection**: Every infrastructure epic connects to user goals and business objectives
- **Development Sequencing**: Prioritize foundation work that enables other development streams
- **Clear Dependencies**: Map relationships between infrastructure components and future UI work

## Process Flow

### Step 1: Technical Requirements Analysis

#### Extract from Product Brief
- **Integration Requirements**: Google Workspace, Office 365, external APIs
- **Authentication Systems**: User management, security, access control
- **Data Architecture**: Storage requirements, data models, relationships
- **Performance Specifications**: Scalability, response times, load expectations
- **Security Requirements**: Data protection, compliance, privacy standards

#### Identify Platform Components
- **Hosting Infrastructure**: Cloud platforms, deployment architecture
- **Database Systems**: Data storage, backup, synchronization
- **API Architecture**: Service design, endpoint specifications
- **Integration Layers**: Third-party connections, data transformation
- **Monitoring Systems**: Logging, analytics, performance tracking

### Step 2: Epic Creation

#### Infrastructure Epics Structure
Each epic should include:

**Epic Definition**:
- **Business Value Statement**: How this infrastructure supports user goals
- **Technical Scope**: Systems, services, and components included
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes and quality standards
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites and connections to other work streams

**Common Epic Categories**:
- **Authentication & User Management**: Login systems, user profiles, permissions
- **External Integrations**: Google, Office 365, third-party APIs
- **Data Platform**: Database design, data models, synchronization
- **Security Infrastructure**: Encryption, compliance, access control
- **Performance Foundation**: Caching, optimization, scalability
- **Hosting & Deployment**: Cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, monitoring

### Step 3: Story Breakdown

#### Technical User Stories
Create stories from multiple perspectives:

**System Perspective**: "As the system, I need to..."
**API Consumer Perspective**: "As a frontend application, I need to..."
**Integration Perspective**: "As an external service, I need to..."
**Operations Perspective**: "As a system administrator, I need to..."

#### Story Components
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear definition of "done"
- **API Specifications**: Endpoint design and data contracts
- **Technical Requirements**: Performance, security, compliance needs
- **Error Handling**: Edge cases, validation, failure scenarios
- **Testing Criteria**: Unit, integration, and system test requirements

### Step 4: Prioritization and Sequencing

#### Foundation-First Approach
1. **Core Infrastructure**: Hosting, database, basic security
2. **Authentication Systems**: User management and access control
3. **External Integrations**: Third-party API connections
4. **Advanced Features**: Performance optimization, advanced security
5. **Monitoring & Operations**: Logging, analytics, maintenance tools

#### Parallel Development Enablement
- **API-First Design**: Define clear contracts for future UI development
- **Independent Components**: Minimize dependencies between infrastructure elements
- **Early Value Delivery**: Balance foundation work with demonstrable progress
- **Risk Management**: Address complex integrations and unknowns early

## Expected Outcomes

### Primary Deliverables
