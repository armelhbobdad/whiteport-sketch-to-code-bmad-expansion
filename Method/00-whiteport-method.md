# The Whiteport Method
## *Design-Driven Development for BMad AI Agent Framework*

---

## What is the Whiteport Method?

The Whiteport Method is a comprehensive design-driven development methodology that enhances the BMad AI agent framework with specialized workflows for transforming hand-drawn sketches into production-ready applications through collaborative workshops and systematic documentation.

**Perfect for**: Teams who want to start with visual concepts and user experience, then systematically derive technical requirements through AI-assisted collaborative workshops.

## Core Principles

üé® **Design-First Development**  
Start with visual concepts and user experience sketches, then systematically transform them into technical requirements and implementation code.

ü§ù **Collaborative Workshop Approach**  
Structured elicitation processes that build requirements through step-by-step dialogue rather than assumptions, ensuring stakeholder alignment and comprehensive understanding.

üìã **Systematic Documentation**  
Structured approach to creating professional documentation with embedded visualizations, consistent terminology, and executive-ready artifacts.

## Method Sequence

The Whiteport Method follows a structured three-phase sequence that builds from strategic foundation through detailed specifications:

### üéØ **Phase 1: Strategic Foundation**
## **[01. Product Brief Discovery ‚Üí](01-product-brief-discovery.md)**

**What it does**: Establish strategic project foundation through conversational discovery  
**How long**: 30-60 minutes foundational discovery + 15-30 minutes brief creation  
**You get**: Strategic project foundation with market analysis, technical architecture, and user types

---

### üó∫Ô∏è **Phase 2: User Research & Personas**
## **[02. Trigger Map Workshop ‚Üí](02-trigger-map-workshop.md)**

**What it does**: Align business goals with user needs AND create detailed personas  
**How long**: 60-120 minutes depending on target groups and persona complexity  
**You get**: Visual map connecting business objectives to user driving forces PLUS prioritized personas with alliterative names and detailed usage goals

---

### üì± **Phase 3: Technical Specifications**
## **[03. Sketch-to-Spec ‚Üí](03-sketch-to-spec.md)**

**What it does**: Transform hand-drawn UI into comprehensive technical specifications  
**How long**: 2-4 hours depending on sketch complexity and pattern variety  
**You get**: Organized component specifications and technical requirements for development

## Key Innovations

‚ú® **Multiple Target Groups per User Type** - Define distinct personas from same user type when they have different needs  
‚ú® **Alliterative Persona Naming** - "Sture Social", "Ellen Entrepreneur" naming for memorability  
‚ú® **Draft-First Option** - Choice between step-by-step workshop or draft refinement  
‚ú® **Executive-Ready Documentation** - Professional artifacts with embedded visualizations  
‚ú® **GitHub-Optimized Visualizations** - Mermaid diagrams designed for GitHub rendering
