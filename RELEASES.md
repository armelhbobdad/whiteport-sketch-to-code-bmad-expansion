The "Whiteport Sketch-to-code method" is the first beta release of an expansion pack designed to empower designers in an AI-driven world.

### **What's New**

This initial release introduces a complete, end-to-end workflow for designers. Key features include:

* **Custom Agent Capabilities**: The roles of the Analyst, PM, and UX Expert have been expanded to specifically support your sketch-driven workflow.
* **New Tasks**: The Analyst is now equipped with the **`create-trigger-map`** task, a new way to define and prioritize user and business goals.
* **New Templates**: The pack includes a new **`synopsis-tmpl.yaml`** for documenting your sketches and a new **`trigger-map-tmpl.yaml`** for creating a mind map of your strategic goals.
* **Orchestrated Workflow**: The **`whiteport-design-workflow.yaml`** file now guides you step-by-step through the entire process, from ideation and sketching to the handoff for development.
