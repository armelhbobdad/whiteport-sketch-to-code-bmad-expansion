# Sketch Documentation Standards

## Overview

This document defines the standards and expectations for sketch documentation within the Whiteport Sketch-to-Code method, ensuring consistency and clarity for development handoff.

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Parentheses Usage
- **Avoid parentheses** in all documentation text
- Use dashes, colons, or separate sentences instead of parenthetical explanations
- Example: Replace "User authentication (login/logout)" with "User authentication including login and logout"
- Exception: Technical code examples where parentheses are syntactically required

## File Structure Standards

### Page Documentation
```
docs/pages/
├── [page-id]-[page-name]/
│   ├── [page-id]-[page-name]_Synopsis.md
│   ├── [page-id]-[page-name].png (or .jpg)
│   └── [page-id]-[page-name]_wireframe.png (if applicable)
```

### Component Documentation
```
docs/components/
├── [component-name]/
│   ├── [component-name]_Specification.md
│   ├── [component-name]_visual.png
│   └── [component-name]_states.png (if applicable)
```

### User Flow Documentation
```
docs/flows/
├── [flow-name]/
│   ├── [flow-name]_Overview.md
│   ├── [flow-name]_flowchart.png
│   └── pages/... (references to page documentation)
```

## Synopsis Document Requirements

Each page synopsis must include:

### Required Sections
1. **Sketch Reference**: Link to actual sketch image
2. **Sketch Context**: User's situation and page purpose
3. **Page Structure**: Hierarchical breakdown of all elements
4. **Referenced Components**: Links to component specifications
5. **Interactions and Effects**: Animation and interaction requirements
6. **Content and Assets**: Text, image, and media specifications
7. **Open Questions**: Undefined or unclear design elements

### Quality Standards
- **Completeness**: Every element in the sketch must be documented
- **Clarity**: Descriptions should be unambiguous for developers
- **Traceability**: Clear connection to user scenarios from PRD
- **Consistency**: Use consistent terminology across all synopsis documents

## Component Specification Standards

### Component Documentation Requirements
- **Visual Reference**: Clear image showing the component
- **Usage Context**: Where and how the component is used
- **States**: All visual states (default, hover, active, disabled, etc.)
- **Responsive Behavior**: How component adapts to different screen sizes
- **Content Requirements**: What content the component displays
- **Interaction Behavior**: How users interact with the component
- **Technical Notes**: Any specific implementation requirements

### Reusability Guidelines
- Components appearing in 2+ places must be documented as reusable
- Variations of similar components should be consolidated when possible
- Component dependencies should be clearly documented

## Sketch Quality Standards

### Visual Clarity
- Sketches should be clear enough to understand layout and hierarchy
- Important interactions should be annotated directly on sketches
- Multiple views or states should be shown when necessary

### Information Density
- Sketches should show realistic content, not just placeholders
- Key copy and messaging should be included in sketches
- Error states and edge cases should be sketched when important

### Consistency
- Use consistent symbols and notation across all sketches
- Maintain consistent component representation across different pages
- Follow established visual hierarchy and spacing patterns

## Content and Asset Documentation

### Text Content
- Headlines and key messaging should be specified exactly
- Body text should indicate tone and approximate length
- Error messages and feedback text should be fully specified
- Call-to-action text should be precisely defined

### Visual Assets
- Describe purpose and content of all images
- Specify image dimensions and quality requirements
- Note any brand or style requirements
- Document accessibility considerations (alt text, etc.)

### Interactive Elements
- Specify all button states and behaviors
- Document form validation and feedback
- Define navigation and linking behavior
- Note any animations or transitions

## Development Handoff Requirements

### Technical Specifications
- Responsive breakpoints and behavior
- Accessibility requirements and ARIA labels
- Performance considerations for images and animations
- Browser compatibility requirements

### Quality Assurance
- Visual design review checkpoints
- User testing validation criteria
- Accessibility testing requirements
- Cross-device testing specifications

## Validation Criteria

Sketch documentation is ready for development when:
- All user scenarios from PRD are represented in sketches
- Every sketch has a complete synopsis document
- All reusable components are properly documented
- Content and asset requirements are fully specified
- Technical implementation is feasible and documented
- Quality assurance criteria are clear and testable

## Maintenance Standards

### Version Control
- Track changes to sketches and documentation
- Maintain change logs for significant updates
- Archive outdated versions appropriately

### Review Process
- Regular reviews ensure alignment with user scenarios
- Cross-team validation before development begins
- Post-implementation review to validate accuracy

### Updates and Iterations
- Document rationale for sketch changes
- Update all affected synopsis documents when sketches change
- Maintain component library consistency during iterations
