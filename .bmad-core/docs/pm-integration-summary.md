# PM Integration Summary for Whiteport Sketch-to-Code Expansion

## Overview

This document summarizes the Product Manager role integration within the Whiteport Sketch-to-Code BMad expansion pack. The PM serves as a critical bridge between strategic trigger mapping, visual design exploration, and technical implementation.

## PM Role in Whiteport Workflow

The PM has three distinct intervention points in the Whiteport workflow:

1. **Scenario Formalization** (Step 2): Transform trigger map insights into structured PRD with user scenarios
2. **Backend Epic Creation** (Step 3): Create technical foundations that support future sketch implementations  
3. **UI Epic & Story Creation** (Step 5): Convert finalized sketches into development-ready specifications

## New PM Capabilities Added

### Specialized Agent Configuration
- **whiteport-pm.md**: Enhanced PM agent (Sarah) with sketch-driven focus and specialized commands
- Maintains backward compatibility with standard PM tasks while adding Whiteport-specific capabilities

### Sketch-Driven Templates
- **sketch-driven-prd-tmpl.yaml**: PRD template optimized for projects that will use sketch-based design exploration
- Integrates trigger map foundations with sketch planning framework
- Includes guidance for scenario definition that supports visual exploration

### Backend-First Planning Tasks
- **create-backend-epics-and-stories.md**: Systematic approach to identifying and specifying non-visual technical requirements
- Ensures API readiness for eventual UI development
- Manages technical dependencies and data architecture needs

### Sketch-to-Code Translation Tasks  
- **create-ui-epics-and-stories.md**: Comprehensive process for converting sketch documentation into development specifications
- Bridges creative visual exploration with structured technical implementation
- Maintains traceability from user goals through sketches to code

### Quality Assurance Integration
- **validate-sketch-scenario-alignment.md**: End-to-end validation that ensures nothing is lost between trigger map, sketches, and final specifications
- **whiteport-workflow-checklist.md**: Comprehensive checklist for PM oversight throughout the entire process
- **sketch-documentation-standards.md**: Standards ensuring sketch documentation supports technical implementation

## Key PM Commands for Whiteport Method

### Core Whiteport Commands
- `*create-sketch-prd`: Create PRD optimized for sketch-driven development
- `*create-backend-epics`: Generate backend technical requirements from scenarios
- `*create-ui-epics`: Transform sketch documentation into UI development specifications
- `*review-trigger-map`: Validate alignment between trigger map and current project state
- `*sync-sketches`: Ensure all scenarios have corresponding sketch documentation

### Standard PM Commands (Retained)
- All existing PM capabilities remain available for hybrid projects
- Brownfield development tasks for existing codebases
- Standard PRD creation for non-sketch-driven projects

## Integration with Existing BMad Ecosystem

### Backward Compatibility
- Whiteport PM agent extends rather than replaces standard PM functionality
- Can be used alongside other BMad agents and expansion packs
- Maintains standard BMad file structure and conventions

### Team Coordination
- Works seamlessly with Analyst (trigger mapping), UX Expert (sketching), and other BMad agents
- Clear handoff points and dependencies defined in workflow
- Supports parallel backend and UI development streams

### Documentation Standards
- Follows BMad markdown and YAML conventions
- Integrates with existing quality assurance and development processes
- Maintains traceability through BMad's standard documentation patterns

## Success Criteria for PM Integration

The PM integration is successful when:

1. **Seamless Workflow**: PM tasks integrate smoothly with Analyst trigger mapping and UX Expert sketching phases
2. **Complete Coverage**: All user scenarios from trigger map are represented in final development specifications
3. **Technical Readiness**: Backend and UI teams can work in parallel with clear specifications and dependencies
4. **Quality Assurance**: Final implementation can be validated against original trigger map user goals
5. **Reusability**: PM approach works across different types of sketch-driven projects

## Usage Recommendations

### When to Use Whiteport PM
- Projects starting with conceptual sketches or wireframes
- User experience exploration is central to the project approach  
- Complex user scenarios that benefit from visual exploration
- Projects where design-development handoff is critical

### Integration with Actimate Project
The Whiteport PM capabilities are particularly valuable for Actimate because:
- Multiple user personas (Helena HR, Nina Normal, Sune Soffa, etc.) benefit from visual scenario exploration
- Three-platform architecture (Admin, Web, Mobile) requires careful UI/UX coordination
- Workplace wellness scenarios are complex and benefit from sketch-driven exploration
- HR management features require careful user experience design

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Pilot Integration**: Test Whiteport PM capabilities on a subset of Actimate user scenarios
2. **Template Refinement**: Refine templates based on actual project usage and feedback
3. **Team Training**: Ensure development teams understand sketch-driven specifications
4. **Quality Validation**: Validate that sketches successfully guide development without ambiguity
5. **Process Optimization**: Iterate on workflow based on real project experience

## Conclusion

The Whiteport PM integration provides a robust bridge between creative sketch-driven design exploration and structured technical implementation, while maintaining full compatibility with the broader BMad ecosystem. This enables projects like Actimate to leverage both strategic trigger mapping and visual design exploration effectively.
