# Whiteport Sketch to Code: The BMad Expansion for Conceptual Design

## Introduction

Designers matter. As a creator and an artist, you are the person who crafts the connection between business success and true user happiness. In a world where AI can generate code and mockups in seconds, your role is not diminished—it is elevated!
The most powerful tool in any project is you, the creator. Your unique thinking, empathy, and passion for the digital experience are what truly make the world a better place, not the code or the machines, regardless of how smart they become.
The Whiteport Conceptual Sketching Method, is a structured way to harness this uniquely human mind. Based on over 20 years of experience in conceptual design and a deep understanding of AI's capabilities and limitations, this method empowers you to lead a creative and exciting journey. You're suddenly center stage, in the limelight, guiding projects to their completion. With a powerful team of agents handling the heavy lifting in the background!
You are the creative linchpin, keeping everyone aligned and focused on a shared vision. Not just designing a user experience, but making sure the vision of the software is realized. In the way that we designers do best, With your pen in hand!

## 1. Core principles

The Whiteport Conceptual Sketching Method is an expansion to the BMad method. This method is a powerful software development method that uses a team of powerful Ai Agents to go from start to finish in a software project. The method builds around agile software practices and have powerful agents representing all competences in a software team guides you through the process. The Anlyst create the project brief, The project manager creates the PRD and breaks the project up in epics and stories. The development the agent executes the development and the QA agent test the end result. With a true human in the loop approach available directly in the IDE

By expanding the BMad method with an intuitive and rewarding design framework for conceptual sketches. The UX Expert agent gets extended capabilities in handling a visual design flow. As you imagine the project, you get suggestions of best practices, assistance in sketching the experience and help in turning your designs into valuable a central part of the overall project documentation. 

The visual communication you facilitate and the sketches you draw is now making sure that both the users and the clients interests are well taken care of. The basic principle is to follow the user step-by-step through the interaction. 

The process starts by defining the overall business goals of the application and the goals of the user. We then design the meeting point of these goals, step-by-step, and visualize it using hand-drawn sketches.

## 2. Advocating for Hand-Drawn Sketches

In the Whiteport Conceptual Sketching method, all types of artifacts are welcomed and useful for creating images that visualise and make the experience understandable for everyone in a software project. However, we highly recommend harnessing the power of concepts by hand during the early phases of conceptual development. This approach offers significant advantages compared to computer-generated assets:
* **Collaborative Communication**: Sketches are easy to draw in front of a whiteboard in workshops, making for instant understanding and using the drawings as a communication technique. The people you work with can jump in, make changes, and contribute to the drawings.
* **Psychological Impact**: A hand-drawn sketch is perceived as a line of thinking rather than a final, ready-to-code artifact. This focus on the core principles of a feature, view, or page, rather than specific details like fonts, is essential in early-stage development.
* **Flexibility and Iteration**: A sketch can be updated and refined as new information comes to light. This allows for constant, low-cost iteration. A simple sketch of four boxes can communicate an entire idea, while a detailed sketch can give deep meaning and clear directions to a designer and a developer.
* **Playful and Engaging**: A hand-drawn sketch is charming and fun, keeping the technical process playful and inspiring for everyone involved, regardless of their technical knowledge.
* **Superior for prompting**: The saying “An image says more than a thousand words”  is equally true  in the age of AI. Your drawings are easily interpreted by today's AI models and will give information that text promises don't manage to convey.

## 3. Tools of the Trade

The conceptual sketching method relies on a few key tools to be effective. Keeping an essential sketching kit is useful for being able to start conceptual work whenever inspiration strikes.
* **Whiteboard Markers**: Always keep a fresh supply of whiteboard markers with you. Markers that have been left uncapped for a long time dry up and do not serve you well.
* **Sticky Whiteboard Material**: You can purchase whiteboard material on a roll from office supply stores. This material clings to flat surfaces using static energy, allowing you to turn any wall or table into a whiteboard for a collaborative sketching session.
* **Clipboard**: A clipboard is the preferred tool for sketching on paper. Unlike a notebook, a clipboard allows you to rearrange and organize your sketches as they are created. This enables you to lay them out on a table and create a continuous user flow, which is more useful for walking people through a user's journey.
* **Pens**: For paper sketching, use ink rollerball pens. While pencils are easy to erase, they are difficult to scan or photograph clearly. The best solution is to use erasable ink pens, which are available at most office supply stores. 
* **White-out strips**: like correction tape, are also useful for making clean corrections when drawing on paper.
### Digital Sketching Tools
We highly recommend that you do your sketches on a pen-enabled laptop or a tablet device.
* **Recommended Devices**: The most practical devices to use are computers where you can fold the keyboard away or remove it altogether. Devices like a Wacom board or a Microsoft Surface computer are great options with excellent drawing capabilities as well as iPads and Android tablets are also great alternatives.
* **Recommended Software**: Microsoft OneNote is a decent application to do the sketches, but any drawing software will fill its purpose. We recommend you try a few of them out and make an informed decision based on your personal preference.

## 4. The Sketching Workflow

The following is a step-by-step workflow for creating a conceptual sketch for a single page or view:
* **Start from the Edges**: Begin by sketching the boundaries of your composition. For a web page, this would be the browser window. The edges provide the necessary context and frame for your composition.
* **Outline Sections**: Once the edges are defined, start outlining each major section or content block within the page. This establishes the high-level layout.
* **Top-to-Bottom, Left-to-Right**: Work your way down the page logically, from the top-left corner. Add sections, components, and interaction elements as you go.
* **Focus on the Top**: The top of the page is typically the most important part, as it's the first thing the user sees. Start here and invest the most effort in this area to ensure the core idea is communicated effectively.

## 5. The Principle of Selective Focus

The method advocates for using selective focus to your advantage. During the initial sketching phase, you should:
* **Start with the Critical Task**: Focus on the most business-critical part of a task first.
* **Utilize the Full Surface**: Use the entire available space to design this core interaction, purposefully ignoring secondary interactions and supporting content that might clutter the page.
* **Enable Focus**: This allows you to focus exclusively on what is important. You can then redraw the sketch at a later stage to incorporate other supporting elements.
* **Avoid Over-stuffing**: Attempting to include everything on the page at the same time is a well-known recipe for disaster.
### The Selective Focus Paradox
While the principle of selective focus—or "willful blindness"—is designed to simplify the design process, it does come with a key trade-off:
* **The Disadvantage**: The method may require you to go back and make iterations or changes to sketches in retrospect. This can feel challenging, especially when you feel tempted to plan each sketch more clearly to reduce the number of adjustments.
* **The Advantage**: The explorative process that results from selective focus is crucial for simplification. Even though it gives rise to later changes, it has proven to create more quality suggestions and better ideas, ultimately improving the usability of the software and making it easier for developers to build the system.

## 6. Designing the User Journey

The following is a step-by-step guide for designing a full user journey for an application:
* **Find the Natural Starting Point**: Embody a specific user with a specific goal and a clearly defined starting point. This could be from a search engine, a social media ad, or the app's start page. The key is to start at the very beginning of the user's interaction, such as in the App Store before the app is downloaded.
* **Sketch the First Screen**: On the first screen of the flow, ask yourself: "What is the most important thing the user should do at this specific moment?" This key action should be given the main space on the page and have a clear call to action.
* **Follow the User's Action**: After sketching the first screen, imagine the user performs the main action (e.g., clicks the main button). You then imagine what should happen next and sketch the second screen in the flow. This step-by-step process continues until the user has accomplished their goal.
* **Pre-planning the scenario is not nececary**: It is possible to plan the typical steps of a workflow beforehand, but this can lead to missing crucial steps or creating an overly complicated flow. By strictly following the user's perspective, you can arrive at more creative solutions, simplify interactions, and skip steps that were initially assumed to be part of the process.

## 7. Sketching Techniques

To manage complexity and maintain clarity, the following advanced sketching techniques are recommended:
### A. Logical Views & Storyboarding
* **Logical Views**: When sketching a page or view, always draw objects in their primary, default state. For example, a dropdown menu is presented as closed if it is not expanded by default on a page. This practice ensures that the initial state of the UI is always the focus.
* **Storyboarding**: When a user action expands a section, reveals new information, or changes a state, you create a separate drawing to show this step-by-step experience. This is done in a numbered sequence, much like a comic book, where you focus only on the objects that are changing. The surrounding page is excluded to maintain focus on the specific interaction. This storyboard is saved as a separate sketch in the same folder as the original logical view or component.
### B. Abbreviation
* **Handling Lists**: To avoid drawing the same object many times, you should use abbreviations. Draw the first three objects in a list in full fidelity. For the remaining objects in the list, you can then practice abbreviations to show the list without having to draw every object in detail. This technique saves time and focuses the viewer's attention on the list's pattern, not its length.
### C. Images and Text Representation
To ensure consistent and clear communication in your sketches, the following conventions are recommended for representing content:
* **Images and Videos**: For images and videos, it is recommended to draw a small cloud symbol inside of the object. This is preferred over a box with a cross, as that symbol has an alternative meaning (such as closing a window).
* **Headlines**: For headlines, use a thicker pen and write out a feasible headline when you can. This helps to set the visual hierarchy and provides a clear direction for the content.
* **Body Text**: Body text is represented by drawing a group of lines representing each line of text. You can easily define the adjustment of the text and a number of visual ques for the designer. The distance between the lines and the distance between the groups of lines will represent the font size and line spacing for this specific paragraph. This method also allows you to show bullet lists and other text decorations that are relevant to the content.

## 8. The Sketching Fidelity Cycle

The sketching process is a continuous, flowing cycle that moves from low to high fidelity. This ensures that everyone in the project is engaged and aligned at each step.
* **Initial Conceptualization**: The process begins with a general discussion with the client about the business goals and software ambitions. This is followed by a conceptualization phase where you draw as you talk, typically in workshops or online screen-sharing sessions, using a tablet or whiteboard.
* **Solo or Team Refinement**: After each session, you take time to sketch freely by yourself or with your team to refine the ideas and prepare for the next round of feedback.
* **Client Confirmation**: You then return to the client to present the refined sketches in higher fidelity. This is a collaborative step where you have a conversation about what the software should look like.
* **Continuous Iteration**: This is a flowing process where, as soon as new ideas or information come to light, you back up and refine the sketches step-by-step until the team and the client are satisfied with the end result.
* **Drawing fast and slow**: The fidelity of your scratch give the viewers insights into the amount of thinking that went into drawing. this means if you have clear slow and deliberate lines in your sketch this will be signaling that it's closer to the final version. Fast and rough  lines communicate more of a conceptual Direction that will need refinement and deliberate processing. The cool thing is that the same sketch could include  very different levels of thinking. the form is clear for example but how the page should look where the form appears is not taken into account yet. 
* **Avoid re-draw a sketch**: Use the sketch you made in the meeting. Add it to the documentation and let the UX Agent descpribe it. Only when you are adding something or making changes to the actual meaning of the sketch should you make the effort to re-draw it. 

## 9. The Synopsis Document: A Guide to the Narrative

Every sketch representing a logical View or storyboard should be explained in the synopsis document this document describes in detail the meaning of the sketch and describes each part of the sketch from the sections down to each piece of content and individual element. Its purpose is to disambiguate a sketch and serve as the single source of truth for both humans and AI agents.
* **Readability and Structure**: When you create a synopsis document, it should use a straightforward and easily understandable syntax. You should make sure to number each section and describe each object within each section.
* **Content and Interactivity**: The synopsis should make space for fixed images and videos, as well as describe interactive parts, animations, or visual effects that are intended to enrich the user experience. The most important thing is that this document is 100% readable for anyone, even without technical knowledge.
* **Highlighting Technical Specifications**: It is possible to add technical recommendations, such as references to special commands, database tables, or other technical issues. In these cases, it should be highlighted that this is additional technical information.
* **Clarity for All**: The purpose of the synopsis is to highlight and add to the understanding of each sketch. For example, a box in a sketch can be a button, a color field, or a progress bar. The synopsis serves to explicitly define the purpose of each object.

## 10. BMad Agents in the Conceptual Design Workflow

The BMad-Method utilizes a team of specialized agents to assist you throughout the entire design and development workflow. In the conceptual phase, specific agents provide expertise to help you move from a raw idea to a structured, ready-to-develop plan.

* **BMad Orchestrator (bmad-orchestrator)**:
    * **Role**: The Master Orchestrator and BMad Method expert. This agent's primary function is to coordinate workflows and manage multi-agent tasks.
    * **How they assist**: My role is to guide you through this entire process. I ensure that the right agent is working on the right task at the right time and facilitate the handoffs between the different specialized agents.
* **Business Analyst (analyst)**:
    * **Role**: An insightful analyst and strategic ideation partner. The Analyst helps you with foundational work like market research, brainstorming, and initial project discovery.
    * **How they assist**: The Analyst helps you define business goals and identify target groups, resulting in the creation of a Project Brief that serves as the project's foundation.
* **Product Manager (pm)**:
    * **Role**: An investigative product strategist and market-savvy PM. The PM's expertise lies in product strategy, feature prioritization, and roadmap planning.
    * **How they assist**: The PM takes the business and user needs from the Project Brief and breaks them into business-critical scenarios. They then help formalize these scenarios into Epics, which are given a logical primary numbering that you will use as the basis for your sketch organization and file naming.
* **UX Expert (ux-expert)**:
    * **Role and Core Function**: The UX Expert, operates as an empathetic, creative, and detail-oriented User Experience Designer and UI Specialist. Her primary focus is on user research, interaction design, and visual design.
    * **Collaborative Design Partner**: The UX Expert serves as your "thinking partner" to refine ideas and translate your conceptual sketches into a structured, actionable plan. She has a keen eye for detail and a deep empathy for users.
    * **Key Deliverables & Tasks**: The UX Expert is responsible for creating a UI/UX Specification (front-end-spec.md). This agent can also craft effective prompts for AI-driven frontend development tools like Vercel's v0 or Lovable.ai, using the generate-ai-frontend-prompt task.
    * **Specific Document Sections & Capabilities**: The UX Expert assists in building and documenting a centralized Component Library, defining the purpose, variants, and states for all reusable components. This agent also helps you define a comprehensive Information Architecture, User Flows (with Mermaid diagrams), Branding & Style Guide, Accessibility Requirements, and a detailed Responsiveness Strategy.

## 11. The Documentation & Component Structure

The core principle of this system is to separate the narrative of the user journey from the building blocks of the user interface. The user journey is documented page-by-page, while the reusable components are specified in a central, single source of truth. This approach creates a highly organized project that is easy to navigate, scale, and maintain for every team member and AI agent involved.
### A. Folder and File Structure
The project will use a two-tiered documentation system for conceptual assets:
docs/pages/[legal-number]-[page-name]/: This is a flow-based folder structure where each page of the user journey gets its own directory. This folder contains all the unique assets for that specific page, such as:
The sketch image ([legal-number]-[page-name].png)
The page-specific synopsis document ([legal-number]-[page-name]_Synopsis.txt)
Any unique storyboards or assets for that page.
docs/components/: This is the central, modular library for all reusable components. Each component gets its own dedicated file (e.g., primary-button.md, page-header.md). This folder serves as the single source of truth for all component specifications.
### B. The Synopsis Document
The [legal-number]-[page-name]_Synopsis.txt document for each page or storyboard serves as the narrative of the user flow. Its purpose is to:
Describe any unique, page-specific artifacts that do not appear elsewhere in the application.
Mention and link to all reusable components that are present on the page, pointing to their master documents in the docs/components/ library.
### C. The Component Document
The master component files in docs/components/ contain all the detailed specifications. This document includes:
A full description of the component's purpose and functionality.
All its possible states, variants, and behaviors.
A "References" section that lists every page where the component is used, linking back to the relevant synopsis document.
### D. The Component Rule
An object or composition on a sketch is defined as a reusable component and is given its own master document as soon as it appears for a second time on any logical view or storyboard in the user journey. Any unique object that only appears once is documented as a page-specific artifact in its corresponding synopsis file.
## 12. Images and Text Representation

To ensure consistent and clear communication in your sketches, the following conventions are recommended for representing content:
* **Images and Videos**: For images and videos, it is recommended to draw a small cloud symbol inside of the object. This is preferred over a box with a cross, as that symbol has an alternative meaning (such as closing a window).
* **Headlines**: For headlines, use a thicker pen and write out a feasible headline when you can. This helps to set the visual hierarchy and provides a clear direction for the content.
* **Body Text**: Body text is represented by drawing a group of lines. The distance between the lines and the distance between the groups of lines will represent the font size and line spacing for that specific paragraph. This method also allows you to show bullet lists and other text decorations that are relevant to the content.
## 13. Conclusion
This guide, built from your own insights and experience, is the key that unlocks the full potential of a sketch-driven workflow. By embracing this method, you're not just designing software—you're crafting a new way of working. You are leveraging the best of your unique skills and combining them with the power of AI to create a process that is more collaborative, more intuitive, and ultimately, more successful.
This is a powerful and inspiring tool that will empower designers to remain relevant in an AI-driven world by focusing on the one thing AI cannot replicate: your unique creative vision.
