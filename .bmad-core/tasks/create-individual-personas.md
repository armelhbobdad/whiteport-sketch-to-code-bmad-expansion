# create-individual-personas

## Purpose

To guide the creation of detailed, individual persona files that provide rich personal context and clear understanding of each user's relationship to the core product activity. Each persona should be a separate document with standardized terminology and comprehensive background information.

## Process

The Analyst will work with the user to create individual persona files based on the target groups identified in the trigger map. Each persona gets its own numbered file with consistent structure and terminology.

### 1. File Structure Requirements
- **Individual Files**: Create separate .md file for each persona
- **Priority Numbering**: Name files by importance (01-primary-persona.md, 02-secondary-persona.md, etc.)
- **Consistent Structure**: Use identical section headers across all personas
- **Reference Integration**: Link to trigger map and avoid duplication

### 2. Terminology Standardization
- **"Driving Forces"** instead of "Motivations"
- **"Usage Goals"** instead of generic "Goals"
- **Positive Usage Goals** start with: "Wants, wishes, prefers, would like, would love"
- **Negative Usage Goals** start with: "Fears, doesn't want, wishes to avoid, would not have happen"
- **Consistent Language**: Apply terminology standards throughout all sections

### 3. Persona Overview Development
- **Rich Personal Context**: Full background that helps reader understand the person holistically
- **Professional + Personal**: Include both work characteristics and life context
- **Personal Relationship to Core Activity**: Dedicated subsection explaining how this persona relates to the product's main function
- **Authentic Voice**: Write as if describing a real person you know well

### 4. Background & Context
- **Professional Situation**: Role, experience level, work style, performance orientation
- **Key Characteristics**: Personal traits, preferences, behavioral patterns
- **Life Context**: Family, time constraints, personal interests that affect product usage
- **Motivation Style**: What drives this person in general (not just product-specific)

### 5. Usage Goals & Driving Forces
- **Positive Usage Goals**: What the persona wants to achieve through product usage
  - Start with action words: "Wants to...", "Wishes to...", "Prefers to...", "Would like to...", "Would love to..."
  - Focus on outcomes and experiences they seek
- **Negative Usage Goals**: What the persona wants to avoid
  - Start with avoidance words: "Fears...", "Doesn't want...", "Wishes to avoid...", "Would not have...happen"
  - Focus on situations, feelings, or outcomes they want to prevent

### 6. Design Implications & User Journey (Combined Section)
- **Critical Success Factors**: What must be true for this persona to succeed
- **User Journey Considerations**: Key moments and decisions in their experience
- **Design Requirements**: Specific interface and experience needs
- **Implementation Priorities**: Features that matter most to this persona

### 7. Success Metrics
- **Persona-Specific Metrics**: How to measure if this persona is successful with the product
- **Behavioral Indicators**: Observable signs of engagement and satisfaction
- **Outcome Measures**: Tangible results that indicate value for this persona

### 8. Personal Relationship to Core Activity (Required Subsection)
- **Current Relationship**: How this persona currently relates to the product's main function
- **Past Experience**: Relevant history that shapes their approach
- **Comfort Level**: Confidence and competence in the core activity area
- **Barriers and Enablers**: What makes the core activity easier or harder for them
- **Ideal Approach**: How they would prefer to engage with the core activity

## Content Guidelines

### Rich Personal Context Requirements:
- **Life Situation**: Family, career stage, time constraints, personal circumstances
- **Personality Traits**: Communication style, decision-making approach, risk tolerance
- **Value System**: What matters most to them professionally and personally
- **Technology Comfort**: How they relate to digital tools and new technologies
- **Social Dynamics**: How they interact with colleagues and prefer to engage with others

### Avoiding Generic Descriptions:
- **Specific Details**: Include specific ages, job titles, family situations, interests
- **Authentic Quotes**: Add believable internal monologue or typical statements
- **Behavioral Examples**: Concrete examples of how they behave in relevant situations
- **Emotional Context**: How they feel about situations related to the product area

### Integration with Trigger Map:
- **Reference Don't Repeat**: Link to trigger map insights rather than duplicating content
- **Build Upon**: Use trigger map user goals as foundation, then add depth and context
- **Consistency Check**: Ensure persona details align with trigger map findings

## Output

Individual persona files that:
- Provide comprehensive understanding of each user type
- Use standardized terminology throughout
- Include rich personal context beyond just professional characteristics
- Clearly explain relationship to core product activity
- Enable design and development teams to make persona-informed decisions
- Reference trigger map without duplication

## File Naming Convention

```
docs/personas/01-[primary-persona-name].md
docs/personas/02-[secondary-persona-name].md
docs/personas/03-[tertiary-persona-name].md
```

## Template Structure

Each persona file should follow this structure:
1. **Header**: Name, priority, role, project context
2. **Persona Overview**: Rich context with "Personal Relationship to Core Activity" subsection
3. **Background & Context**: Professional and personal characteristics
4. **Usage Goals & Driving Forces**: Positive and negative with standardized language
5. **Design Implications & User Journey**: Combined requirements and considerations
6. **Success Metrics**: Persona-specific measurement criteria

## Handoff Integration

These detailed persona files serve as:
- **Reference Material**: For trigger map and product brief linking
- **Design Foundation**: For interface and experience decisions
- **Development Guidance**: For feature prioritization and implementation
- **Testing Framework**: For user validation and success measurement
