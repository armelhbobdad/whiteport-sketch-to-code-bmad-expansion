# create-ui-epics-and-stories

## Purpose

To transform finalized conceptual sketches and their documentation into detailed epics and user stories that guide UI/UX development. This task bridges the creative sketch phase with structured development planning by extracting actionable development requirements from the sketch synopsis documents.

## Process

The PM will analyze the completed sketch documentation, synopsis files, and component library to create comprehensive user stories that accurately represent the visual design intent and user interaction requirements.

### Analyze Sketch Documentation

* **Review Synopsis Documents**: Read through all page synopsis documents in `docs/pages/` to understand the intended user experience
* **Component Inventory**: Catalog all reusable components identified in `docs/components/` and their usage patterns
* **User Flow Analysis**: Map the user journey across all sketched pages to identify interaction sequences
* **Content Requirements**: Extract all content, copy, and asset requirements from the sketch documentation
* **Interaction Patterns**: Identify consistent interaction patterns, animations, and responsive behavior requirements

### Create UI/UX Epics

For each major user flow or functional area, create epics that group related UI development work:

* **User-Centric Epic Names**: Name epics based on user goals from the trigger map (e.g., "User Onboarding Experience", "Activity Tracking Interface")
* **Visual Design Scope**: Reference specific sketches and synopsis documents that define the epic's visual requirements
* **Component Dependencies**: Identify which reusable components need to be built or modified for this epic
* **Responsive Design**: Include requirements for different screen sizes and devices based on sketch annotations

### Extract User Stories from Sketches

* **Page-Level Stories**: Create stories for each sketched page/screen, referencing the synopsis document
* **Component Stories**: Create separate stories for each reusable component in the component library
* **Interaction Stories**: Create stories for specific user interactions, animations, and micro-interactions
* **Content Stories**: Create stories for content creation, copywriting, and asset preparation
* **Accessibility Stories**: Ensure accessibility requirements are included based on sketch annotations

### Story Structure and Format

Each story should include:

* **User Story Format**: "As a [persona from trigger map], I want [interaction from sketch] so that [goal from trigger map]"
* **Sketch Reference**: Direct link to relevant sketch image and synopsis document
* **Acceptance Criteria**: Detailed criteria based on the sketch specifications and component documentation
* **Definition of Done**: Include visual design review, responsive testing, and accessibility compliance
* **Technical Notes**: Any specific technical requirements or constraints noted in the sketches

## Elicitation Requirements

elicit: true
format: structured-review

### Review Process

1. **Sketch Completeness Check**: "Are all user scenarios from the PRD represented in the finalized sketches?"

2. **Component Consistency**: "Do all reusable components have consistent behavior and visual design across different usage contexts?"

3. **User Flow Validation**: "Do the sketched user flows successfully address all user goals from the trigger map?"

4. **Technical Feasibility**: "Are there any sketched interactions or designs that present technical implementation challenges?"

5. **Missing Interactions**: "Are there any user interactions or edge cases that aren't covered in the current sketches?"

6. **Content Strategy**: "Is the content strategy clear for all text, images, and multimedia elements in the sketches?"

## Output

A comprehensive backlog of UI/UX-focused epics and user stories including:

* **Epic Roadmap**: Prioritized epics that align with user goals and technical dependencies
* **Component Backlog**: Complete list of reusable components to be developed, with specifications
* **Page Stories**: User stories for each sketched page/screen with clear acceptance criteria
* **Interaction Stories**: Detailed stories covering animations, transitions, and micro-interactions
* **Content Requirements**: Stories for all content creation, copywriting, and asset development needs
* **Testing Stories**: Stories for design review, user testing, and accessibility validation

## Integration with Development Handoff

* **Design System Foundation**: Ensure component stories establish a clear design system for consistent UI development
* **Developer-Friendly Specifications**: Structure stories with technical details that developers need for implementation
* **Design Review Process**: Include design review checkpoints in story acceptance criteria
* **Asset Management**: Clearly specify how design assets and exported resources will be managed and shared

## Quality Assurance Integration

* **Visual Design Testing**: Include QA checkpoints for pixel-perfect implementation of sketched designs
* **Responsive Testing**: Ensure testing across different devices and screen sizes as specified in sketches
* **User Experience Testing**: Include user testing criteria based on the original user goals from trigger map
* **Accessibility Testing**: Incorporate accessibility testing requirements throughout the UI development process

## Success Criteria

The UI epics and stories are successful when:
* Every sketched page and interaction has corresponding user stories with clear acceptance criteria
* All reusable components are properly documented and specified for development
* Stories maintain clear traceability back to original user goals from the trigger map
* Development teams can implement the sketched designs without ambiguity or missing requirements
* The story backlog supports iterative development while maintaining design consistency
