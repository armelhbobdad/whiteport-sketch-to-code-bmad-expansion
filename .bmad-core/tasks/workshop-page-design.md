# workshop-page-design

## Purpose

To use the trigger map as a strategic guide for workshopping and designing specific pages or logical views. This task ensures every design decision is grounded in clear business goals and user driving forces, connecting high-level strategy directly to low-level design details.

## Process

The UX Expert collaborates with the designer to workshop page design using the trigger map insights, ensuring each design element serves specific business goals and user driving forces identified in the trigger map analysis.

### 1. Trigger Map Strategic Review

#### **Business Goals Alignment**
Before beginning any sketch, review the relevant business goals:
- **Primary Business Goal**: Which business vision does this page primarily serve?
- **Hard Goals**: What measurable outcomes should this page contribute to?
- **Success Metrics**: How will this page's effectiveness be measured?
- **Strategic Priority**: How critical is this page to overall business success?

#### **Target Group Focus**
Identify which target groups this page primarily serves:
- **Primary Persona**: Which persona is the main user of this page?
- **Secondary Personas**: Which other personas might use this page?
- **Persona Context**: What situation brings each persona to this page?
- **Cross-Persona Considerations**: How do we serve multiple personas without conflict?

### 2. Customer Awareness Level Analysis

#### **Current Awareness Level Assessment**
Estimate where users are in Eugene Schwartz's Customer Awareness Cycle when they first encounter this page:

**1. Unaware**: Users don't recognize they have a problem or need
- *Typical Pages*: Landing pages, first-time visitor experiences, social media entry points
- *Design Implication*: Gently introduce potential areas of improvement
- *Content Strategy*: Educational content that sparks curiosity without overwhelming
- *Call-to-Action*: Soft engagement like "Learn more" or "Explore possibilities"

**2. Problem Aware**: Users recognize a problem but don't know solutions exist
- *Typical Pages*: Problem-focused content pages, search result pages, pain point articles
- *Design Implication*: Empathize with their problem and validate their concerns
- *Content Strategy*: Problem-focused messaging that builds trust and understanding
- *Call-to-Action*: "Discover solutions" or "See how others solve this"

**3. Solution Aware**: Users know solutions exist but not familiar with your specific approach
- *Typical Pages*: Product category pages, comparison pages, solution overviews
- *Design Implication*: Highlight unique benefits and differentiate from competitors
- *Content Strategy*: Feature-focused messaging that shows your unique value
- *Call-to-Action*: "See how we're different" or "Compare approaches"

**4. Product Aware**: Users know about your product but unsure if it's right for them
- *Typical Pages*: Product detail pages, feature pages, demo requests, pricing pages
- *Design Implication*: Build trust through testimonials, demos, and detailed information
- *Content Strategy*: Proof-focused messaging with social validation and specifics
- *Call-to-Action*: "Try it free" or "See it in action"

**5. Most Aware**: Users are ready to purchase but need final motivation
- *Typical Pages*: Checkout, signup forms, onboarding flows, upgrade prompts
- *Design Implication*: Streamline conversion with clear CTAs and urgency
- *Content Strategy*: Action-focused messaging with incentives and simplicity
- *Call-to-Action*: "Start now" or "Get started today"

#### **Target Awareness Level Progression**
Define where you want users to be AFTER interacting with this page:

**Awareness Advancement Goal**:
- **Current Level**: Where users start when they encounter this page
- **Target Level**: Where users should be after successful page interaction
- **Progression Strategy**: How the page content and interactions move users forward
- **Success Indicators**: How to measure if awareness progression is working

**Example Progression Patterns**:
- **Landing Page**: Unaware → Problem Aware ("Now I understand I have this issue")
- **Problem Page**: Problem Aware → Solution Aware ("Now I know solutions exist")
- **Solution Page**: Solution Aware → Product Aware ("Now I want to try this specific product")
- **Product Page**: Product Aware → Most Aware ("Now I'm ready to buy/signup")
- **Signup Page**: Most Aware → Active User ("Now I'm successfully onboarded")

#### **Cross-Persona Awareness Mapping**
Different personas may be at different awareness levels for the same page:
- **Helena HR**: May be Solution Aware when researching wellness platforms
- **Nina Normal**: Likely Problem Aware about workplace fitness participation
- **Sune Soffa**: Often Unaware of gentle fitness solutions that might work for him
- **Multi-Level Design**: How to serve multiple awareness levels on the same page

#### **User Journey Awareness Progression Framework**
Map awareness evolution across the entire user experience:

**Stage-by-Stage Awareness Mapping**:
1. **Entry Point Assessment**: What awareness level do users have when first encountering the system?
2. **Page-Level Progression**: How does each page advance awareness to the next level?
3. **Journey Checkpoints**: Key moments where awareness shifts should occur
4. **Conversion Readiness**: When users reach "Most Aware" and are ready for action
5. **Post-Conversion Education**: How awareness continues to develop after signup/purchase

**Awareness Progression Examples for Software Systems**:

**SaaS Application Journey**:
- **Marketing Site**: Unaware → Problem Aware
- **Product Tour**: Problem Aware → Solution Aware  
- **Demo/Trial**: Solution Aware → Product Aware

### 6. Golden Circle Content Strategy with AI Prompt Generation

#### **Strategic Content Hierarchy Framework**
Use Simon Sinek's Golden Circle model integrated with awareness levels to create systematic content that progresses from overarching to granular:

**Content Flow Structure**:
1. **WHY (Overarching)**: Purpose/belief that resonates with persona usage goals
2. **HOW (Medium-level)**: Unique approach that addresses persona driving forces
3. **WHAT (Granular)**: Specific features/actions that serve business goals

**Section-by-Section Content Planning**:
Each page section follows WHY → HOW → WHAT progression, with each sentence beginning with purpose-driven language connected to trigger map insights.

#### **AI Content Prompt Generation Framework**
Create systematic prompts for AI content generation using trigger map insights:

**Standard Content Prompt Template**:
```
"Create [section type] content for [Persona Name] ([key characteristics]) at [Awareness Level] addressing their usage goal '[Specific Usage Goal]' to achieve business goal '[Business Goal]':

WHY: Start with the belief/purpose that resonates with their [positive/negative usage goals]

```

### 7. Content and Messaging Workshop with Awareness Levels

#### **Awareness-Level Specific Messaging**
Craft messaging that matches user awareness level and driving forces:

**Unaware Level Messaging**:
- "Did you know..." (gentle problem introduction)
- "Many [persona type] discover..." (peer identification)
- "What if you could..." (possibility without pressure)

**Problem Aware Messaging**:
- "Struggling with..." (validation and empathy)
- "You're not alone in..." (social validation)
- "Finally, a solution for..." (hope introduction)

**Solution Aware Messaging**:
- "Unlike other approaches..." (differentiation)
- "Specifically designed for..." (targeted solution)
- "The [persona-type] way to..." (persona-specific framing)

**Product Aware Messaging**:
- "See how [similar persona] succeeded..." (social proof)
- "Join [number] other [persona type] who..." (community evidence)
- "Designed with [specific concern] in mind..." (targeted reassurance)

**Most Aware Messaging**:
- "Start your [specific outcome] today..." (immediate action)
- "Join now and [specific benefit]..." (clear value proposition)
- "Ready to [achieve positive goal]?" (assumption of readiness)

**Combined with Driving Forces**:
- Positive Goal Language + Awareness Level = "Finally achieve [positive goal] with the approach designed for [awareness level concern]"
- Negative Goal Reassurance + Awareness Level = "No more [negative fear] - this approach specifically prevents [awareness level anxiety]"

#### **Visual Content Strategy**
Using driving forces to guide imagery:

**Positive Goal Imagery**:
- People achieving the specific outcomes users want
- Technology that feels helpful rather than intimidating
- Social situations that look inclusive and encouraging
- Professional settings that convey competence and success

**Negative Goal Avoidance**:
- Avoid intimidating fitness imagery for reluctant participants
- Skip complex dashboard screenshots that might overwhelm
- Exclude competitive scenarios that might create anxiety
- Remove anything that suggests judgment or comparison

### 7. Interactive Behavior Workshop with Awareness Progression

#### **Awareness-Progressive Micro-Interactions**
Design interactions that help users advance through awareness levels:

**Awareness Progression Support**:
- Educational tooltips that gently introduce concepts (Unaware → Problem Aware)
- "Learn more" expansions that provide deeper solution context (Problem → Solution Aware)
- Comparison tools that highlight your unique approach (Solution → Product Aware)
- Trial interactions that let users experience the product (Product → Most Aware)

**Confidence Building by Awareness Level**:
