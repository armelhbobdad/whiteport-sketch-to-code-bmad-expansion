# create-trigger-map

## Purpose

To guide the Designer in creating a trigger map by identifying and prioritizing what a user needs in order to convert themselves from a user to a customer. By getting their wishes fulfilled, they will provide value to the various business goals and objectives. The trigger map serves as a foundation for identifying success factors and the driving forces behind the product.

## Process

The Analyst will manage a workshop with key stakeholders and ask a few specific questions. The answer to each question leads to the next. The model is based on the Effect Mapping method created by InUse in Sweden in the nineties.

### Define Business Goals

The Analyst will guide the Designer in defining goals in a tree structure, starting with a Soft Goal and then defining the Hard Goals that prove it is being fulfilled.

* **Soft Goals**: The Analyst should first ask for the overall goals of the project in simple terms. These are verbalized as a qualitative description that communicates the ambition of the product, such as "Best on the market," "Most convenient choice," or "Top of mind for..."
* **Hard Goals**: Next, the Analyst will focus on the hard goals, which are measurable and act as proof that the soft goal is being fulfilled. These could be "top ranking," "X number of views," or "Y number of users." [cite_start]The hard goals can be formulated in accordance with the "SMART" criteria[cite: 1].
* **Validation**: Before moving on, the Analyst should double-check if the Designer agrees that fulfilling the hard goals would indeed be a satisfactory way to fulfill the soft goals.

### Identify Target Groups

The purpose of this process is to find the most valuable user groups that the product should be designed for and prioritize them. The principle is that the needs of the most prioritized group should take precedence in any design decision.

* **Identification**: Target groups represent the intersection between a general user group (e.g., customers, travelers) and their unique demographics or characteristics (e.g., tourists, commuters). The Analyst should ensure that the needs of these groups are real and that the groups are clearly distinguishable from one another.
* **Naming**: It helps if the names of the groups are memorable and rhyming, such as "Stuart Student" or "Peg the Pensioner."
* **Description**: Each group should have a description that details their user type, demographics, and special interests.
* **Prioritization**: We usually try to identify the three to five most important target groups, as having more might be distracting. The needs of the most prioritized group should always be the focus of the design.

### Find the user's driving forces through identifying usage goals

The Trigger map differs from other workshop methods in its focus on Usage Goals. This unique method focuses on the user's ultimate buying decisions, which are often driven by emotional factors.

* **Positive and Negative Goals**: The Analyst will ask each user, "What do you, as a user, want to have happen and what do you wish to avoid when faced with using the product?" The defined usage goals are stated as a positive goal (what they want) and a negative goal (what they want to avoid). For example, "becoming wealthy" and "not staying poor" are technically the same, but the design, content, and imagery might be radically different for each formulation.
* **Structured Questions**: The Analyst can choose to separate the questions into two parts: first identifying the positive driving forces by asking, "What do these users want?" and then following up by asking, "What do they wish to avoid?"

## Output

A well-organized hierarchical list or mind map, of the users desired outcomes and situations avoided sorted by importance and impact on the business. The most important function, fulfilling the goals of the primary target group, should be developed first.

## Document Application and Usage

* The trigger map is designed to be a living document used for managing the expectations of the project.
* After the product has been tested with users, the map can also be used as a script for evaluating the end product.
* For example, if a user's goal is "to feel sure they are not making any mistakes," as a positive user goal, this goal can then be used to create questions for a test subject during a user testing session to ensure that the user indeed felt safe during the whole experience.
