# create-trigger-map

## Purpose

To guide the user in creating a detailed trigger map based on the foundational product brief. The trigger map expands on the business goals and user groups identified in the product brief to create detailed user-business alignment mapping. This serves as a foundation for persona development and requirements identification.

## Process

**CRITICAL: This is a COLLABORATIVE WORKSHOP process. The Analyst must STOP after each step and wait for user input before proceeding. Do not complete multiple steps or assume answers.**

The Analyst will manage trigger map creation with key stakeholders, building upon the completed product brief to create detailed trigger map analysis. The model is based on the Effect Mapping method created by Inuse in Sweden.

## Initial Approach Assessment

**FIRST: Assess Available Information** - Review the completed product brief for existing insights about business goals, target users, success metrics, and market context.

**IF substantial project brief information exists**, offer the user two options:

**Option A: Draft-First Approach**
"Based on the comprehensive project brief we just completed, I have enough information to create an initial trigger map draft. Would you like me to create a first version that we can then review and refine together? This might be faster than starting from scratch with the step-by-step questions."

**Option B: Traditional Step-by-Step Workshop**
"Or we can go through the traditional collaborative trigger map process step-by-step, building it from the ground up through our workshop questions."

**Benefits of Draft-First Approach:**
- Leverages existing project brief insights efficiently
- Provides concrete artifact for user to react to and refine
- Accelerates process when solid foundational information exists
- Still maintains collaborative refinement and validation

**STOP HERE** - Wait for user to choose their preferred approach before proceeding.

### Step 1: Establish Customer Pattern Understanding
**MANDATORY ELICITATION**: Start with foundational questions about customer patterns:

- **Question 1**: "Do you see any patterns in your current or potential customers? Do you see any natural types of customers, users, or visitors?"
- **Question 2**: "What do you call your different target groups? Are they customers, visitors, guests, users, members, subscribers, etc.? Note that different target groups can have different names."

**STOP HERE** - Wait for user responses before proceeding. These answers establish the terminology and foundational understanding for the entire trigger map.

### Step 2: Review and Refine Business Goals
**ONLY after Step 1 is complete**, explore organizational value with the overarching question:

**Overarching Question**: "Let's explore what you, as an organization, imagine that you will get in terms of value from building/refining this product?"

- Ask: "Based on the product brief, what are the specific, measurable business goals that these [use their terminology from Step 1] should help you achieve?"
- **STOP HERE** - Wait for user input to refine and quantify the business goals with hard metrics.

### Step 3: Identify and Detail Target Groups
**ONLY after Step 2 is complete**, work with the user to identify target groups:

- Ask: "Who, in the world, will, by using the system in the intended way, ensure that the business goals are fulfilled?"
- Ask: "Of the [customer types from Step 1], which ones are most critical to achieving [specific goals from Step 2]?"
- **STOP HERE** - Wait for user input to define and prioritize target groups.

### Step 4: Define Usage Goals for Each Group
**ONLY after Step 3 is complete**, explore target audience value with the overarching question:

**Overarching Question**: "Let's now explore what your target audience will get, in terms of value, out of interacting with this product."

- For each group, ask: "Why would a [target group name] use this product? What do they want to happen and what do they want to avoid?"
- **STOP HERE** after each target group - Wait for user input before moving to next group.

### Step 5: Create Strategic Insights
**ONLY after all target groups are defined**, synthesize insights:

- Ask: "Based on what we've discovered, what should be our primary development focus?"
- **STOP HERE** - Wait for user input on prioritization and strategic direction.

**IMPORTANT**: Complete the trigger map document ONLY after all elicitation steps are finished and user has provided all input.

**CRITICAL**: Always create both the trigger map document AND the trigger map poster visualization simultaneously. The poster should have the Mermaid diagram at the top underneath the headline, followed by strategic insights.

## Output

A well-organized hierarchical list or mind map, of the users desired outcomes and situations avoided sorted by importance and impact on the business. The most important function, fulfilling the goals of the primary target group, should be developed first.

## Document Application and Usage

* The trigger map is designed to be a living document used for managing the expectations of the project.

* After the product has been tested with users, the map can also be used as a script for evaluating the end product.

* For example, if a user's goal is "to feel sure they are not making any mistakes," this can be defined as a positive user goal. This goal can then be used to create questions for a test subject during a user testing session.

## Defining Business Goals: Soft and Hard Goals

The Analyst will guide the user in defining goals in a tree structure, starting with a Soft Goal and then defining the Hard Goals that prove it is being fulfilled.

* **Soft Goals**: The Analyst should first ask for the overall goals of the project in simple terms. These are verbalized as a qualitative description that communicates the ambition of the product, such as "Best on the market," "Most convenient choice," or "Top of mind for..."

* **Hard Goals**: Next, the Analyst will focus on the hard goals, which are measurable and act as proof that the soft goal is being fulfilled. These could mean "top ranking," "X number of views," or "Y number of users." The hard goals can be formulated in accordance with the "SMART" goal method.

* **Validation**: Before moving on, the Analyst should double-check if the user agrees that filling the hard goals would indeed be a satisfactory way to fulfill the soft goals.

## Defining Target Groups

The purpose of this process is to find the most valuable user groups that the product should be designed for and prioritize them. The principle is that the needs of the most prioritized group should take precedence in any design decision.

* **Identification**: Target groups represent the intersection between a general user group (e.g., customers, travelers) and their unique demographics or characteristics (e.g., tourists, commuters). The analyst should ensure that the needs of these groups are real and that the groups are clearly distinguishable from one another.

* **User Type Classification**: Each target group must map to one of the user types defined in the project brief. This ensures logical consistency between personas and business model. Common classifications include Reader, Advertiser, Partner, Public servant, or other project-specific types.

* **Naming**: It helps if the names of the groups are memorable and alliterative, such as "Sture Social" or "Clara Curlingmum." This naming convention improves memorability and creates professional consistency across projects.

* **Description**: Each group should have a description that details their user type, demographics, and special interests.

* **Multiple Target Groups per User Type**: Feel free to define more than one target group from the same user type if there are groups with different needs and driving forces. Example: "Active Community Connector" and "Time-Pressed Parent" are both Reader user types but represent distinct target groups with different motivations and constraints.

* **Prioritization**: We usually try to identify the three to five most important target groups, as having more might be distracting. The needs of the most prioritized group should always be the focus of the design.

## Defining Usage Goals

The Trigger map differs from other workshop methods in its focus on **Usage Goals**. This unique method focuses on the user's ultimate buying decisions, which are often driven by emotional content.

* **Emotional Focus**: The Analyst will ask the general question, "What do these users want to have happen as a consequence of interacting with the product?" The answers should be primarily emotional in nature.

* **Positive and Negative Goals**: The answers should be in a positive or negative form. Positive usage goals are the vision-based driving forces behind the interaction, while negative goals describe what the user wishes to avoid. For example, "becoming wealthy" and "not staying poor" are technically the same, but in an interactive product, the design, content, and imagery might be radically different for each formulation.

* **Structured Questions**: The Analyst can choose to separate the questions into two parts: first identifying the positive driving forces by asking, "What do these users want?" and then following up by asking, "What do they wish to avoid?"

## Document Language and Terminology

**Business Goals Terminology**: In discussions with users, refer to "soft goals" and "hard goals" to explain the concept. However, in the final trigger map document, use cleaner headings:
- Replace "Soft Goals" with "Business Visions" 
- Replace "Hard Goals" with "Hard Goals" (keep this term)
- This maintains clarity without cluttering the document with workshop terminology

**Usage Goals Format**: Always structure usage goals with clear positive/negative indicators:
- Positive goals: "Wants to...", "Wishes to...", "Prefers to...", "Would like to..."
- Negative goals: "Fears...", "Doesn't want...", "Wishes to avoid...", "Would not have happen..."
