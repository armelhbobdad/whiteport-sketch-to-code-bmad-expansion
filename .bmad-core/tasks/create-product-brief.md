# create-product-brief

## Purpose

To guide the creation of a comprehensive product brief that bridges strategic user research (trigger map and personas) with technical requirements and development planning. The product brief serves as the foundation for PRD creation and stakeholder alignment.

## Process

The Analyst will work with the user to create a product brief based on completed trigger map and persona analysis. This document translates user research into actionable technical and business requirements.

### 1. Executive Summary Creation
- **Project Overview**: Name, core problem, solution approach in 2-3 sentences
- **Target Market**: Primary market segment based on trigger map analysis
- **Key Value Proposition**: How the solution addresses persona-specific needs
- **Business Context**: Reference trigger map business visions without duplication

### 2. Key Assumptions (Prominent Placement)
- **Business Assumptions**: Budget authority, market willingness, purchasing decisions
- **Technical Assumptions**: Development approach (AI-first, platform choices, timeline)
- **User Assumptions**: Persona engagement patterns, behavior expectations
- **Format**: Clear bullet list placed prominently after executive summary

### 3. Problem Statement Development
- **Current State**: Pain points derived from trigger map business visions
- **Impact Quantification**: Use hard goals from trigger map for measurable impact
- **Urgency Drivers**: Why this problem needs solving now
- **Source Material**: Direct reference to specific trigger map insights

### 4. Solution Overview
- **Core Concept**: High-level approach addressing persona-specific needs
- **Platform Architecture**: Technical decisions explained through persona lens
- **Key Differentiators**: How approach serves identified personas uniquely
- **Persona Integration**: Why platform choices support different user types

### 5. Target User Summary
- **Format**: Brief descriptions with clear links to detailed persona files
- **Content**: Executive summary of primary and secondary personas
- **Avoid**: Repeating full persona content - reference and summarize only
- **Prioritization**: Clear indication of MVP focus personas

### 6. Platform Architecture Justification
- **Technical Decisions**: Platform choices justified by persona usage patterns
- **User Experience**: How different platforms serve different personas
- **Integration Points**: Cross-platform features supporting persona workflows
- **Rationale**: Clear connection between technical choices and user research

### 7. MVP Scope Definition
- **Feature Prioritization**: Based on primary persona needs from persona analysis
- **Must-Have Features**: Essential for primary persona success
- **Secondary Features**: Nice-to-have for secondary personas
- **Out of Scope**: Clear exclusions with persona-based reasoning

### 8. Constraints & Timeline
- **Development Approach**: Actual methodology (AI-first, traditional, hybrid)
- **Timeline**: Realistic project timeline based on chosen approach
- **Resource Constraints**: Team size, budget, technical limitations
- **Compliance**: Security, privacy, enterprise requirements

## Output

A comprehensive product brief document that:
- Provides executive-level overview for stakeholder buy-in
- Translates user research into technical requirements
- Establishes clear development parameters
- Creates foundation for detailed PRD creation
- Links to but doesn't duplicate trigger map and persona content

## Document Application and Usage

- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Use for executive buy-in and project approval
- **PRD Foundation**: Serves as input for detailed requirements documentation
- **Architecture Guidance**: Informs technical architecture decisions
- **Scope Management**: Reference for feature prioritization throughout development
- **Assumption Tracking**: Living document for validating key assumptions

## Handoff Instructions

Upon completion, this product brief provides complete context for PM agent to begin PRD creation in structured, section-by-section collaboration with the user.
