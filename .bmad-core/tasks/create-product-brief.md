# create-product-brief

## Purpose

To guide the creation of a foundational product brief that establishes project vision, strategic direction, and high-level requirements. The product brief serves as the foundation for subsequent trigger map analysis, persona development, and PRD creation.

## Process

The Analyst will work with the user to create an initial product brief that defines the project's strategic foundation. This document will guide the creation of detailed user research (trigger map and personas) and technical requirements.

### 1. Executive Summary Creation
- **Project Overview**: Name, core problem, solution approach in 2-3 sentences
- **Target Market**: Primary market segment based on initial market understanding
- **Key Value Proposition**: How the solution addresses anticipated user needs
- **Business Context**: High-level business visions and strategic direction

### 2. Key Assumptions (Prominent Placement)
- **Business Assumptions**: Budget authority, market willingness, purchasing decisions
- **Technical Assumptions**: Development approach (AI-first, platform choices, timeline)
- **User Assumptions**: Persona engagement patterns, behavior expectations
- **Format**: Clear bullet list placed prominently after executive summary

### 3. Problem Statement Development
- **Current State**: Pain points identified through initial discovery and stakeholder input
- **Impact Quantification**: Establish measurable business impact goals
- **Urgency Drivers**: Why this problem needs solving now
- **Source Material**: Stakeholder interviews, market research, business needs

### 4. Solution Overview
- **Core Concept**: High-level approach addressing anticipated user needs
- **Platform Architecture**: Initial technical decisions and architectural direction
- **Key Differentiators**: How approach serves target market uniquely
- **User Integration**: Why platform choices support expected user workflows

### 5. Target User Summary
- **Format**: High-level user group descriptions for subsequent detailed persona development
- **Content**: Initial user segments and basic characteristics
- **Purpose**: Foundation for detailed trigger map and persona analysis
- **Prioritization**: Preliminary indication of MVP focus user groups

### 6. Platform Architecture Justification
- **Technical Decisions**: Platform choices based on business requirements and user expectations
- **User Experience**: How different platforms will serve anticipated user needs
- **Integration Points**: Cross-platform features supporting expected workflows
- **Rationale**: Clear connection between technical choices and business strategy

### 7. MVP Scope Definition
- **Feature Prioritization**: Based on business priorities and anticipated user needs
- **Must-Have Features**: Essential features for business success
- **Secondary Features**: Nice-to-have features for enhanced user experience
- **Out of Scope**: Clear exclusions with business and technical reasoning

### 8. Constraints & Timeline
- **Development Approach**: Actual methodology (AI-first, traditional, hybrid)
- **Timeline**: Realistic project timeline based on chosen approach
- **Resource Constraints**: Team size, budget, technical limitations
- **Compliance**: Security, privacy, enterprise requirements

## Output

A foundational product brief document that:
- Provides executive-level overview for stakeholder buy-in
- Establishes strategic direction and business requirements
- Creates foundation for subsequent trigger map and persona development
- Defines technical approach and development parameters
- Guides detailed user research and requirements analysis

## Document Application and Usage

- **Strategic Foundation**: Foundation for all subsequent workflow steps
- **Trigger Map Guidance**: Informs business goals and user group identification
- **Persona Development**: Provides context for detailed user research
- **PRD Foundation**: Serves as input for detailed requirements documentation
- **Architecture Guidance**: Informs technical architecture decisions
- **Assumption Tracking**: Living document for validating key assumptions

## Handoff Instructions

Upon completion, this product brief provides strategic context for the Analyst to begin detailed trigger map creation, followed by persona development and eventual PRD creation.
