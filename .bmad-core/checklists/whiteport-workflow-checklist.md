# Whiteport Workflow Checklist

## Pre-Sketch Phase (PM Tasks)

### Trigger Map Validation
- [ ] Trigger map is completed with clear business goals
- [ ] Target user groups are prioritized and well-defined
- [ ] User driving forces (positive/negative goals) are identified
- [ ] Business goals connect clearly to user goals

### PRD Foundation
- [ ] Sketch-driven PRD created using sketch-driven-prd-tmpl.yaml
- [ ] Core user scenarios defined (5-8 scenarios maximum)
- [ ] Each scenario connects to trigger map user goals
- [ ] Technical constraints documented
- [ ] Success metrics defined and measurable

### Backend Epic Creation
- [ ] Backend requirements identified from user scenarios
- [ ] Data models and API endpoints defined
- [ ] Authentication and authorization requirements specified
- [ ] Integration points with external systems documented
- [ ] Backend epics prioritized by dependency and value
- [ ] Backend user stories created with clear acceptance criteria

## During Sketch Phase (PM Monitoring)

### Scenario-Sketch Alignment
- [ ] All user scenarios have corresponding sketch exploration
- [ ] Sketches address the core user driving forces from trigger map
- [ ] Complex user flows are properly broken down in sketches
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios are considered in sketches

### Documentation Quality
- [ ] Synopsis documents are created for each sketched page
- [ ] Component library is maintained and updated
- [ ] Reusable patterns are identified and documented
- [ ] Content and asset requirements are captured

## Post-Sketch Phase (PM Tasks)

### UI Epic Creation
- [ ] All sketched pages have corresponding user stories
- [ ] Component development stories are created
- [ ] Interaction and animation requirements are specified
- [ ] Responsive design requirements are documented
- [ ] Content creation stories are included

### Development Readiness
- [ ] Backend APIs are ready to support UI development
- [ ] Component library provides clear development specifications
- [ ] User acceptance criteria include design review checkpoints
- [ ] Technical feasibility of all sketched interactions is validated

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Visual design testing criteria are defined
- [ ] Responsive testing requirements are specified
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are included
- [ ] User testing plan connects back to trigger map goals

## Handoff Validation

### Documentation Completeness
- [ ] All user scenarios are covered by epics and stories
- [ ] Traceability from trigger map → PRD → sketches → stories is clear
- [ ] Component specifications are complete and consistent
- [ ] Content and asset requirements are fully documented

### Development Team Readiness
- [ ] Backend team can begin work immediately
- [ ] Frontend team has clear design specifications
- [ ] QA team has testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] All dependencies between teams are identified and managed

## Success Criteria

The Whiteport workflow is successful when:
- [ ] Every user goal from trigger map is addressed in final stories
- [ ] Sketches successfully guide development without ambiguity
- [ ] Backend and UI work can proceed in parallel efficiently
- [ ] Final product can be validated against original trigger map goals
