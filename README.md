# Whiteport Sketch-to-code method

## Introduction

In an age where AI can generate code and mockups in seconds, a designer's role is not diminished—it is elevated. The Whiteport Sketch-to-code method is a BMad Expansion Pack that empowers designers to use their unique creative skills to guide and direct an AI-powered development team. This method is a structured way to harness the human mind that creates new ideas and visualizes a user's journey, making you the creative linchpin in a successful project.

## The Whiteport Method

The method is based on a structured, collaborative workflow that moves from hand-drawn conceptual sketches to a fully realized project. It is built on a few core principles:
* **Human-Centric Design**: The process is guided by your unique creative vision and empathy for the user.
* **Sketch-Driven Documentation**: Hand-drawn sketches, wireframes and code-based visualizations become a central part of the project's documentation, rather than a separated workflow, making the vision clear for everyone involved.
* **Making sense of each logical view**: After each step of the interaction is created as a sketch, wireframe or Example code snippet, the view is then described in detail. All page sections and building blocks are outlined in the "Synopsis" document and as soon as an object occurs more than once it is broken out into separated components.
* **Iterative Refinement**: The workflow is designed for continuous, low-cost iteration, allowing you to discover and simplify the best possible interactive solution for each specific user.
* **Sketches as an infromation dense part of the PRD**: As the sketches is created in the context of the various user flows, each view becomes a rich and highly directional part of the overall specifications. Each sketch is in this way helping to make sense of the product in a relevant and readable format for both Humans and Ai.
* **AI-Assisted, Not AI-Led**: AI agents are used as a powerful team to handle the heavy lifting, freeing you to focus on the truly essential work of creative exploration.

## How It Works

This expansion pack provides specialized agent capabilities and a clear documentation structure that turns your sketches into a ready-to-develop plan. It leverages the following agents from the BMad framework:
* **Analyst**: Helps you with initial brainstorming and strategy.
* **PM**: Formalizes your user scenarios into a prioritized project plan.
* **UX Expert**: Collaborates with you to turn your sketches into a detailed design system.
* **Orchestrator**: Guides you through the entire process, from ideation to development.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install BMad**: Ensure you have the BMad-Method framework set up in your IDE.
2.  **Add the Expansion Pack**: Clone this repository into your project's `.bmad-core/expansion-packs/` folder.
3.  **Activate**: Run the appropriate command in your IDE to activate the "Whiteport Sketch-to-code method" expansion.
4.  **Begin**: Start with the Analyst agent to define your project, and let your pen guide the way.
