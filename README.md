#### Writing Style Guidelines
- **No Parentheses**: Use dashes, colons, or separate sentences instead
- **Progressive Building**: Documents grow incrementally during workshops
- **Positive Reflection**: Acknowledge and build upon user input
- **Clear Terminology**: Consistent vocabulary throughout documentation

#### Mermaid Diagram Standards
- **GitHub Compatibility**: Light gray color palette, left-to-right flow
- **Structure**: Business goals ‚Üí Platform ‚Üí Target groups ‚Üí Driving forces
- **Styling**: Professional monochromatic appearance
- **Placement**: Diagrams at top of poster documents, under headlines

### Key Methodological Innovations

#### Multiple Target Groups per User Type
Instead of "persona splitting," define multiple target groups from the same user type when they have different needs and driving forces. Example: Both "Active Community Connector" and "Time-Pressed Parent" are Reader user types but represent distinct target groups.

#### Draft-First Trigger Map Option
When substantial project brief information exists, offer users the choice between:
- **Traditional Step-by-Step**: Complete workshop elicitation process
- **Draft-First Approach**: Create initial trigger map from brief, then refine collaboratively

#### Executive-Ready Documentation
All major artifacts include executive summary README files with embedded visualizations serving as project dashboards and navigation hubs.
